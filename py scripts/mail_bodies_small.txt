Subject: Request to Connect With Your Students | From EECS, IISc Bangalore
To: albert@iitpkd.ac.in <albert@iitpkd.ac.in>


Dear Colleague,



I hope my email finds you doing well. I am writing to you on behalf of the
Dean, EECS, IISc Bangalore <https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/departments/>. EECS
Division consists of 4 different departments
<https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/departments/> focusing on a large number of
research areas such as Micro/Nanoelectronics, SP/Comm, AI, Neuromorphic,
Power Electronics, Robotics, IoT, Quantum
Computing/Communication/Sensing/Photonics, Deep Learning, Theoretical
Computer Science, Computer Systems & Software, Intelligent Systems,
Computational Electromagnetics, Virtual Reality, Cyber-Physical Systems,
5G/6G Communication, etc.



The purpose of this personal note is to seek your help to connect to the
final and pre-final year students and immediate graduates of your institute
from departments/programs related to ECE/EE/CS. We are embarking on several
new programs in IISc, which require us to boost our Ph.D. intake
significantly. Studies have indicated that students often do not get
first-hand exposure to opportunities in India. This leads to many leaving
India to search for Ph.D. opportunities elsewhere. In addition, students
are often unaware of the opportunities post-Ph.D. Besides, there are also
several misconceptions about Ph.D. *We wish to change this by directly
engaging with students. In this direction, we want to host a session on
Oct. 27th (details will be shared with students who register) in which we
wish to engage with students across the country and walk them through (1)
Global opportunities, in general, post-Ph.D. in India, (2) Why one should
do Ph.D., (3) Who should peruse Ph.D., and in the end (4) Ph.D.
opportunities in EECS (ECE/EE/CS), IISc Bangalore. As we gather experience,
we will offer more such sessions in the future.*



Through this exercise, we also wish to reach out to economically/socially
underprivileged students. This will help us to understand their
apprehensions, if any, towards Ph.D. and how we can address this to
encourage every talented student to embark on a Ph.D. journey, independent
of their societal/economic background. We will also discuss the private
fellowships (over and above the Ph.D. stipend) available in EECS IISc, for
such students.



We hope you will agree that we are embarking on a challenging task, which
will be difficult without your help. Keeping this in mind, *may we seek
your support to help us connect with your students by forwarding/sharing
this email with your immediate graduates and students in the
final/pre-final years of your B-Tech/Dual-Degree/M-Tech programs under
ECE/EE/CS areas. It would be helpful if your students could fill out this
google form before Oct. 21st to register for the online event (2 Hrs) on
Oct. 27th: https://forms.gle/8VX3vJV24AY7D39g8
<https://forms.gle/8VX3vJV24AY7D39g8> *



I appreciate any help you can provide. We look forward to
meeting/interacting with your students. If you have any suggestions, please
reply to this email.





Best regards

when companies visit their campuses. *A sample report is attached to the
email.*

We will also provide a consolidated report on the performance of all the
students based on which you can decide what areas you should conduct
training. *A sample report is attached to the email.*

Cases of plagiarism
by Albert Sunny - Tuesday, 4 October 2022, 10:21 PM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the past week, I have caught several cases of plagiarisms in labs 3, 4
and 5. In sprite of giving ample time (almost a week) to work in each labs
it is disheartening to see several of your resort to such unethical means.
While I encourage discussions to get a better understanding of the task at
hand, discussing or sharing codes is frowned upon. If you do not what is
plagiarism, have a look at
https://www.plagiarism.org/article/what-is-plagiarism [1]

If you are having difficulty understanding the questions, attend the Monday
afternoon sessions where the lab questions are discussed in detail. Do not
use lack of understanding as an excuse to pass off other's code as your
own. Several students say they plagiarized codes because of placements
tests / lack of time. This is a an unreasonable excuse. If you are pressed
for time and have other priorities, skip the lab for that week. It is a
better option than plagiarizing.

I hope you realize that an IDC action / fail grade in an S7 core course
would mean that you will have to stay back for one more year to complete
the course, and your plans for job / higher studies would be disrupted. So,
think well before you plagiarize again in my course!!!

*Idioms*

In continuation to the mail sent out last week, here are some more idioms
that relate to money:

1. Break even

To neither gain nor lose money.

“The trip to Mysore cost me Rs40,000, but I almost broke even after winning
Rs35,000 as tech-contest prize money.”

2. Break the bank

To be very expensive.

“Taking a month-long vacation to be either in the hills or by a beach would
break the bank. There’s no way I could afford to do it right now.”

3. To be closefisted

Someone who doesn’t want to spend money. Similar to being stingy.

“Karishma is so closefisted, she won’t even contribute to buy snacks for
the proposed Diwali party.”

4. To go Dutch

Everyone pays for their own meal at a restaurant.

“We had our first date last evening and we went Dutch. I paid for my coffee
and she paid for her salad.”

5. Shell out money/to fork over money

To pay for something (usually expensive).

“I wish I didn’t buy that new car now that I’m shelling out Rs18,000 a
month in EMI payments.”

“She had to fork over a lot of money for traffic fines last month.”

Dear sir,

For Lab 5 questions 1 and 3 were done entirely by me. Question 2 I didn't
know how to approach the problem, so I asked Jasir(111901025) to explain it
to me on pen and paper. He told me what data structure to use and explained
the algorithm case by case, which I directly implemented. He also helped me
fix bugs in question 2 where I was having trouble. I did not explicitly
copy his code, but I did refer to his pseudocode which he explained on
paper for writing my solution. I am sorry for my mistake, but I promise it
was not done intentionally.

Dear Student,

TAs of CS4150 have informed me (with adequate proof) that your lab 5 codes
look very similar to your batch-mate's code. I am writing this mail to you
seeking an explanation for such a similarity.

[FOR FIRST TIME OFFENDERS] If you are willing to admit that you have indeed
plagiarized the code, and submit an undertaking that you will not involve
in such activities in the future, you will be awarded zero marks for lab 4
and no other action will be taken.

[FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS] A decision will be made after seeing your
explanation. Note that if you are indeed guilty, confession may lead to a
mild penalty.

Note that you have time till *10:00 AM, Tue, 04 Oct 2022* to respond to

Subject: [Broadcast] Pale Blue Dot 4
To: <broadcast@iitpkd.ac.in>


Dear all,
It is our great pleasure to invite you for the fourth lecture in the Pale
Blue Dot - IIT Palakkad Public Lecture Series. The details of the talk are
given below.

*Speaker: *Dr. Manunath Krishnapur, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore.
*Title*: "*Taking Chances; Making Decisions*"
*Date and time:   *08*.*10.2022, 04.00 PM
*Venue: *Victoria College Auditorium , Palakkad
*Abstract: *Like basic arithmetic, basic skills to read and interpret data
is essential to survival in the modern world where surveys, polls,
statistics from scientific studies, sports figures, economic data, etc. are
thrown at us all the time. We take many half-real half-made-up situations
to illustrate correct and incorrect ways to do this. The level of
mathematical sophistication required will be kept at high-school level, and
an attempt made towards a relaxed lecture, just short of putting the
audience to sleep.

*About the speaker: *Dr. Manjunath Krishnapur is a Mathematician at Indian
Institute of Science Bangalore. He has made outstanding contributions to
the field of Probability Theory. His discoveries have been published in the
most reputed Mathematics journals, including Annals of Mathematics, as well
as in reputed Physics journals because of their relevance to Statistical
Physics. He is also a favourite "Math teacher" to many Math and non-Math
students of IISc.

Dear All,

A talk by Dr Manjunath Krishnapur of the Indian Institute of Science is
scheduled as per the following details.

Date & Time: *Friday, 07 October at 2 pm*

Venue: Auditorium, Ahalia campus

Title: Exact distribution of zeros in random polynomials and analytic
functions


Abstract: In random matrix theory, there are numerous models of random
matrices whose eigenvalue distributions can be computed exactly. In the
adjacent field of random polynomials there are hardly any. About the only
one is the discovery of Peres and Virag (around 2005) concerning the zeros
of the random analytic function on the unit disk: F(z)=g_0+g_1z+g_2z^2+…
where g_k are i.i.d. standard complex Gaussian random variables. Although F
has infinitely many zeros, they gave an exact determinantal formula to
compute the joint distributions. As a corollary, the mean, variance, and
exact distributions of the number of zeros in the sub-disk of radius r can
be computed. Recently we found a new proof of this theorem starting from
the uniform random polynomial whose zeros are in the unit disk. The key is
to find a description of these random polynomials in terms of orthogonal
polynomials on the unit circle. We describe this proof in the lecture.

Biography of the speaker: Manjunath Krishnapur is an Associate Professor at
the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, and an excellent speaker of
Mathematics. More details about him can be found here
<http://math.iisc.ernet.in/~manju/>.

All are cordially invited.

Thanks & Regards
Ashok.

DAY 329
05/10/2022

*OVERCOMING DIFFICULT EMOTIONS*


 In meditation, we can reflect on things that challenge us in our lives
with great power because in meditation we have the “home court” advantage
over those challenges. When they come up in life, they can surprise us, but
in meditation, we can call them forth to deal with them.

  ♦ Take a seat and set a timer for at least five minutes.
  ♦ Bring to mind a challenging person, place, or thing.
♦ Breathe into it and notice the different thoughts and feelings you have
around it.
  ♦ With every exhale, release the old ways of feeling, clearing through
the discomfort.
  ♦ Imagine that the next time you are faced with this challenge in life,
you are stronger, more stable, and less affected by it.

year 2022-23. Please make sure that all of you have to login and apply for
the eligible schemes through the portal. The students who had applied for a
scheme in the previous academic year shall apply for a renewal of the same
and others have to apply for fresh scholarships.You can check the
guidelines and FAQs available on the National Scholarship Portal for more
details on the same. If you are facing any technical issues or facing any
difficulty in application for the scholarship issued by National
Scholarship Portal you may contact the helpdesk of the portal either
through contacting them over telephone at 0120 - 6619540 or by writing
email to helpdesk@nsp.gov.in (from 8 AM to 8 PM on all days, excluding
holidays)
It has to be noted that if you are eligible for the scholarship through NSP
then it is mandatory to apply for the same and you can mention the same
while applying for the renewal of institute scholarship. In such cases the
institute scholarship will be renewed with a condition that the amount
received from NSP has to be paid to the institute account since availing
two government scholarships simultaneously  is not advisable as per
instructions from the GoI norms. This is for your information and action
from your end at the earliest.

*****************************************************

Dear Students,

*Attention B. Tech and M. Sc. students who were availing the
institute scholarship during the academic year 2021-22*,

This is to inform you that for the purpose of renewal of
various scholarships offered to you from the institute, you are requested
to submit the valid annual family Income certificate (April 2021-March 2022
period). The income certificate has to be issued by the Tahsildar or other
competent Revenue authority from your respective locations (issued on or
after 01-04-2022 or should  be valid as on 30-09-2022).

A detailed list of competent authorities who are authorized to issue the
annual family income certificates is attached herewith this mail for your
reference. Annual income certificates signed by officials other than the
designated persons will not be accepted.

All the students must apply for the scholarships through the
National Scholarship Portal. If a student misses to apply in the NSP or
does not provide the non-availability of any schemes for which he/she is
eligible then he/she has to forgo his/her institute scholarship for the
academic year 2022-23.

If the same student is eligible for both the institute as well as a
scholarship through the NSP portal, he/she may be allowed to renew the
institute scholarship, with a condition that the student has to remit the
amount received from NSP scholarship to the institute account, since a
student is not allowed to avail two government scholarships simultaneously.

You are advised to fill in the google form and upload the supporting
documents  here
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpyD0BvzDtTMHkN8FZ9Iqm1spBb62lAk8O4tHt-Uglp6TYxQ/viewform?usp=sf_link>

The deadline for giving the renewal applications to the institute will be
15 days from the date of opening of the NSP portal. A separate email will
be sent once the institute receives information from the concerned ministry
about the opening of the NSP for submitting the applications.

The applications for the renewal of scholarships shall be submitted latest
by 31-08-2022.

*Please note that no extensions will be provided for the institute
scholarship renewal applications.*

Please contact us in case of any queries/ clarifications

Thanks

Dear sir,

No, I haven't plagiarised from any batchmate's code.
For the first question I referred
https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/dijkstra.html#implementation and the
implementation is almost exactly the same so my code might look similar to
people who referred the same link. I didn't think this was a problem since
the problem was very straightforward and that was the usual implementation
I have used before.

For the second question, after the completion of my solution, on discussion
with batchmates, I realised there was a more reliable way to ensure
convergence. This also was by discussion and no copying of code was
involved.

I received the mail only an hour ago, that's why I could not reply within
the deadline.

Dear Student,

TAs of CS4150 have informed me (with adequate proof) that your lab 4 codes
look very similar to your batch-mate's code. I am writing this mail to you
seeking an explanation for such a similarity.

If you are willing to admit that you have indeed plagiarized the code, and
submit an undertaking that you will not involve in such activities in the
future, you will be awarded zero marks for lab 4 and no other action will
be taken.

If you are denying everything and your explanation is not satisfactory,
after personally observing your performance in the upcoming viva 1, I will
raise a formal complaint with the Institute Disciplinary Committee.

Note that you have time till *10:00 AM, Tue, 04 Oct 2022* to respond to
this mail (reply all). Failure to respond to this mail within the above
deadline will be considered as your admission of plagiarizing the code.

Regards,
Albert

*****************************************************

Hello everyone,

Hope all are doing well! From the plethora of mails, I see there has been a
flurry of activities in this semester and that the preparations for Inter
IIT have begun! Happy to see such mails and especially happy to hear
offline activities resuming like before!

Now, as you may see from the subject and the content of this thread, I
write to update you all that *the remainder of the fund that was collected
as part of the donation drive during the peak of the COVID has been handed
over from my SAC to the new SAC, with the current General Secretary,
Jyothiradhithya, holding the funds, totalling to Rs 76,699, (same as the
remaining amount mentioned in the last email in this thread) for the time
being. *

Moreover, as was mentioned while this donation drive was started, that if
there was any amount that remained after the threat of the COVID was
negligible, we would donate the remaining amount to something meaningful,
which would be in line with the spirit with which the fund was collected.
It is more than safe to say that COVID does not seem to be a threat of
severity anymore. So we would like to donate the remaining fund as
promised. For the same, *we would like you, the students who had made the
donations benevolently to the drive, to fill this form:
https://forms.gle/mo3VDmDTwadDWrcT6 <https://forms.gle/mo3VDmDTwadDWrcT6>
and give your opinion on where you would like the fund to be donated. *

I would like to once again thank all the students who had donated to this
fund, I would like to thank the Institute for their help during those tough
times, and last but definitely not the least, I would like to once again
thank the whole team of students and faculty alike that were involved in
making sure we would be able to reach out to students that needed our help
the most in those difficult times.

And, like in those times, I would like to again wish you and your family
the best of health, always.

PS: I hope to read more mails on all the awesome work and fun that you guys
are having at the institute!!! :D

Best,

Dear All,

Hope you are doing well and keeping safe!

This mail is just to update you on the details of the fund. The amount in
the fund as of now is 91,699 rupees only. It is truly a huge number and I
once again sincerely thank all of you for your most kind benevolence!

Secondly, but more importantly, we have just recently taken a decision to
support one afflicted student who needs urgent help. The approved amount
being donated to the person as of now is 15k based on the requirements (so
the updated amount in the fund will be 76,699 rupees). We will be sure to
update all of you on the further usage if any.

Thirdly, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the institute,
they have recently helped two students with huge sums of money from the IIT
Palakkad Charitable Trust, sums which were beyond our capacity. My
sincerest and humblest thanks once again to the institute, especially to
Anuradha ma'am and Samuel sir for always being there and proactively
reaching out to us as well!

As the cases seem to decline, at least in some states, we hope this second
wave subsides soon enough! Lastly, a redundant but important request
nonetheless, please do take care of yourself and your family members and

Dear All,

Hope you and your family member are doing well and keeping safe! Please do
take care of yourself and your family members and keep checking up on your
friends!

I feel immense pleasure in notifying all of you that we have been able to
collect 89,604 rupees in the drive as of today!! This is a huge amount and
I personally feel very humble and grateful to each and every one of you who
has come out strong in these difficult times! Truly, truly great work and I
once again thank and each and every one of you for your kind benevolence!

Lastly, I would like to make an important announcement with regards to an
update in our fund distribution policy. As you may know, the prices of
essential medicines have shot up due to high demand and because of the
same, some students may face difficulty in paying the inflated amount.
Hence, we have decided that *we will donate rupees 5000 to anyone facing
financial issues with medication*. If the student needs further assistance,
we will contact the institute since they may be able to help much better
and also, please note that the primary use case of our funds, or the
primary idea we have in mind, is that it should go to a person who needs
the money urgently for a bed (general or ICU) and is facing financial
trouble. And as we have mentioned in the previous mail, the price for a bed
can go very high so the amount (for medicinal purposes) has been capped
keeping that in mind. However, if you have any questions or concerns,
please feel free to reply to this mail.

Wishing you and your family the best of health,
Thank you,
Shrujan.

Dear All,

As you know, many of our friends, some of whom you may know, have been
affected severely by the second wave of COVID. Our prayers are with them
and their family.

Friends, as you also know, we had asked in the form whether you or your
friend would need financial support or not. And sadly, some of the affected
students are not in a well-off financial position and with regards to the
same, we are starting a donation drive. The QR code and the UPI ID is given
below (thanks to Juttu Anurag, club head, Finance club). We understand that
you may also be stressed financially and hence we request you to come
forward and only donate as per your capacity.

[image: WhatsApp Image 2021-05-08 at 12.18.24 PM.jpeg]
UPI ID: sathamhrushikesh@paytm

This is a business account ID so no need to worry about any transaction
limits. The fund distribution policy that we have currently come up with is
as follows:


   - We will donate rupees 20,000 to any student who urgently needs a
   general bed and is struggling with the finances
   - We will donate rupees 50,000 to any student who urgently needs an ICU
   bed with a ventilator and is struggling with finances.

Of course, we hope the fund will be able to get sufficient liquidity for
this. Other situations may be dealt with on a case-to-case basis. Any other
updates will be communicated as needed.

Friends, these are indeed really tough times and I once again urge you all
to please take care of yourselves, your family, and keep checking on your
friends regularly. If any of your friends need any help, please don't
hesitate to contact us. We shall try and arrange anything and everything we
can. We shall overcome this, together!

Wishing you and your family the best of health,

Hello everyone!

Hope you all are having a good time.

We are delighted to announce the success of the Petrichor ‘23 pre-fest
workshop series that boasted 460+ participants from 47 colleges extending
to 4 states. It was a pleasant surprise for us to see numerous students
arrive from the length and breadth of South India to attend the workshops
conducted on Game Development, IC Engines, Artificial Intelligence, and
Real-time signal processing for IoT edge-based devices. The eagerness that
the participants showed for the sessions was energizing for our professors,
who returned the favor with equal energy.

I'm sure both the student communities had a wonderful time interacting with
each other while getting to know about our college and Petrichor.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude towards our speakers Prof.Anand T.N.C,
Prof.Pramod Kuntikana, Vishnu B Raj, Narendra Kumar, Prof. Sabarimalai
Manikandan, and the members of YACC including Jyothiradhithya, Jerry John,
Amish Saxena & Harsh Dubey.

We couldn’t have done this without the support of Prof.Afzaal Ahmed
(Faculty Advisor, Petrichor), Prof.Arvind Ajoy (Technical Advisor,
Petrichor), Prof. Jagadeesh Bayry (Dean students), and Prof.Sovan Lal Das
(Dean Academics).

Special thanks to Samuel Sir, Biju Sir, and Unni Sir along with the CFET
team and Electronics lab staff for their guidance throughout the event.

Last, but surely not least; The volunteers. We cannot appreciate them
enough. They served as the soul of the event, proactive from the very
beginning until the end to make this happen.



Stay tuned for upcoming activities of Petrichor and our annual fest in
January. Here’s to reaching greater heights.

*Idioms*

Today let's consider some common idioms related to money:

1. Born with a silver spoon in one’s mouth

Someone who comes from a wealthy and successful family.

“Jayesh was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. His parents bought him
everything he wanted and sent him to the best private schools.”

2. To go from rags to riches

To go from being poor to having a lot of money.

“Actor Jim Carrey went from rags to riches. At one time, he was living in a
van, but he continued to work hard and eventually became one of the
highest-paid comedians in the world.”

3. Pay an arm and a leg for something

To pay a lot of money for something. You can also say that something “costs
an arm and a leg.”

“The price of chocolate has doubled. I nearly paid an arm and a leg for a
small bar.”

“Chocolate costs an arm and a leg now.”

4. To have sticky fingers

To be a thief.

“The manager fired the cashier because he had sticky fingers. He stole more
than Rs2000 in a month.”

5. To give a run for one’s money

To compete with someone at their level and make them really work for their
win.

“Jayson  really gave me a run for my money in the chess tournament. He
almost beat me!”

Dear All,

Ms. Mimisha M Menakath who is working with the guidance of Dr. Mahesh R
Panicker will be presenting her research proposal on 28th September 2022 at
03:00 PM through online mode.

Title: Signal Processing for Underwater 3D Acoustical Imaging System

Date & Time: 28th September 2022 at 03:00 PM

Venue: Zoom meeting details are given below

Meeting ID: 953 7949 3716

Passcode: 114058

Meeting link: https:
https://zoom.us/j/95379493716?pwd=djJzUnBkd1VMSXhuL0NaMDMwRkRDUT09

ABSTRACT :

Ocean exploration using underwater acoustical 3D imaging is becoming
popular as it provides information about the 3D geometry of the targets. In
the underwater acoustical 3D imaging system, the major components are an
omnidirectional transmitter and a uniform 2D receiving array. The
transmitter sends an ultrasound pulse of suitable frequency. When the
transmitted pulse encounters any change in the medium acoustic impedance, a
part of transmitted energy will be reflected back. The backscattered echoes
are collected by using the 2D receiving array. The 3D image of the region
of interest is reconstructed from the backscattered echoes. Delay and Sum
beamforming is the promising technique used to convert received time
information into space information or image. The major challenges for
designing an underwater 3D imaging system are the cost and complexity of
the hardware, computational complexity and large memory requirements of the
existing imaging algorithms. Designing a sparse 2D array which provides the
same beam pattern as a uniform 2D array is one way to reduce the
complexity, cost and memory requirements. A sparse 2D array with a minimum
number of elements will be designed. Another way is to develop fast and
compute efficient beamforming algorithms. We developed a fast-beamforming
algorithm with significant reduction in computational complexity and memory
requirements. However, conducting real experiments to validate imaging
algorithms and sparse array designing algorithms is the bottleneck on the
research of underwater acoustical 3D imaging. Since a suitable simulation
tool for modelling realistic underwater scenarios is not yet available, the
development of such a simulation tool is also important. We exhaustively
utilized the k-Wave toolbox for modelling underwater targets. As the
resolution of the reconstructed image is very poor, image processing such
as segmentation is also required for the better interpretation of the
reconstructed images. A suitable segmentation algorithm will be developed
to separate underwater targets from sediment reverberation.


All are cordially invited.

Dear Students,

Despite repeated mails, the attitude of some of you has not changed.
We will find those involved and take appropriate action. That means, those
students may not be able to use the computer lab in the future.

While we encourage you to make use of all the facilities, it is your duty
to follow the rules and regulations. Otherwise you will face the
consequences.

Thank you,
Jagadeesh

Despite being given repeated notices not to bring the eatables to the

lab and littering the wrappers inside the lab.

This kind of attitude is unacceptable.

Dear Students,

We would like to bring to your kind attention that the students are not
allowed to bring any eatables and water bottles to the computer lab.
Despite being given multiple warnings, the students are bringing water
bottles and spilling water over the computer tables. Please do avoid it.

The Labs are to be considered as places for serious study. For the
discussions and meetings you may choose any free class rooms.

Usage of Laptops within the computer lab makes the resource wastage which
otherwise would have been used by some other users.
So, we request you to use PCs in the computer lab, instead of Laptops when
you are inside the Lab.
Also, kindly do not remove the keyboard and mouse connected to the PCs in
the computer lab.

It has been noticed that the students are bringing their mobile chargers to
the computer labs and plug into the free socket available along with the
socket connected to the system.
When you about to leave the lab, you switch off the power to remove the
charger, but eventually, Computer gets shutdown uncleanly.  This would
create data loss and other related issues with the computer.
So, we request you to use the mobile chargers only when it is absolutely
necessary. It would be nice that if you could use plug points outside the
lab.

It has also been noticed that the students are keeping their baggage on the
chairs in the computer lab and go out for their other activities/classes.
We urge you to take your belongings when you leave the computer lab.
Kindly do not treat our computer labs as cloak rooms.


Kindly cooperate with us for the smooth running of the lab.

Dear Sir/Madam

Greetings from IIT Madras!

We are glad to inform you that the third edition of Carbon Zero Challenge
(CZC), an All India Eco-Innovation and Entrepreneurship competition was
launched on 24 August 2022. CZC 2022 aims to accelerate the lab-to-market
transition of eco-innovations in India by funding innovations from
proof-of-concept, lab-scale solutions to working prototypes or pilots.

The Theme for CZC2022 is CZC for CRC  “Circularity in Resources
Conservation”. CZC 2022 would focus on fostering innovative solutions
incorporating circularity and sustainability for managing and conserving
the following resources - Air, Water, Soil, Materials, and Energy.

If you are a college faculty or student, or an early stage startup
innovating in any of the above domains and interested in implementing your
technology in the field through entrepreneurship, we strongly encourage you
and your team to apply for CZeroC.

The deadline for application is Oct 10, 2022. We will be shortlisting about
100 teams, of which  25 teams will be given prototype funding up to Rs 5
lakhs per team. The teams will be connected to experts in industry and
academia to hone their technical and business skills. Based on their
performance, the CZC winners in the final evaluation get a 10 lakhs startup
seed grant and continued support, including access to the IITM incubation
ecosystem.

Please check out our website http://www.czeroc.in for more details and the

Subject: Accenture Japan: Special Webinar
To: placement@iitpkd.ac.in <placement@iitpkd.ac.in>


Dear IIT Career and Placement Office,

Greetings. I am writing to inform you that Accenture Japan will be holding
a special online seminar on: “Guide to Working in Japan for Women,” and
would like to know whether your students would be interested in joining in.

Through the years of hiring through IIT’s placements, Accenture Japan has
had an experience wherein candidates (mostly females) had reservations in
taking up a post away from India due to concerns about safety, possible
treatment, and worries of their parents.
The company would like to help in addressing this situation and give a free
online seminar about what it is like to live and work in Japan especially
for females.

The details are as follows:
*PRESENTED BY:* Accenture Japan Ltd.
*DATE:* 28th September, 2022;

30th September 2022
*You may choose which to attend depending on your availability

*TIME:* 12:00-13:10 IST
*VENUE:* Zoom
*PARTICIPANTS:* Anyone (max. 1000 people)
*REGISTRATION:* We require registration for the webinar to better estimate
the number of people who will be attending.

Registration Link:
*https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1516641547143/WN_xs4xrDHcT_SgoOXyWha5PQ
<https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1516641547143/WN_xs4xrDHcT_SgoOXyWha5PQ>*



While the content of the online seminar mainly focuses on the experience of
women in Accenture Japan, there will also be a lot of information on Japan
and what it is like to work and live in the country in general, as well as
the common onboarding practices, so even male participants are welcome to
join and listen. We also highly encourage the parents of the students to
join so that they may directly address their worries via asking questions.
Students from lower years who are greatly considering a career in Japan may
also join.

We would greatly appreciate it, if you could share this information with
your students and encourage them to join.
Please note that while the contents of this online seminar is
career-related, we do not consider this as a part of the placement process
and participation is not required to apply for Accenture Japan.

Through these efforts, we hope to see more and more candidates be open to
career options in Japan in the future.

Thank you. Hoping for a positive response.


Sincerely yours,
Accenture Japan Hiring Partner

Dear all,

Dr. Tanay Nag, who is a postdoctoral fellow at RWTH Aachen University,
Germany, will be presenting an online seminar on 27th September (Tuesday)
with the details as follows

Speaker: Dr. Tanay Nag

Title: Dynamical construction of Quadrupolar and Octupolar topological
superconductors

Time: 4:30 pm

Zoom link details: https://zoom.us/j/95139854192
                             Meeting ID: *951 3985 4192*

Abstract:  We propose a three-step periodic drive protocol to engineer
two-dimensional~(2D) Floquet quadrupole superconductors and
three-dimensional~(3D) Floquet octupole superconductors hosting
zero-dimensional Majorana corner modes~(MCMs), based on unconventional
d-wave superconductivity. Remarkably, the driven system conceives four
phases with only 0 MCMs, no MCMs, only anomalous π MCMs, and both regular 0
and anomalous π MCMs. To circumvent the subtle issue of characterizing 0
and π MCMs separately, we employ the periodized evolution operator to
architect the dynamical invariants, namely quadrupole and octupole motion
in 2D and 3D, respectively, that can distinguish different higher order
topological phases unambiguously. Our study paves the way for the
realization of dynamical quadrupolar and octupolar topological
superconductors.

All interested are welcome to attend !!!

Dear All,
*A Final reminder*
We have identified the unclaimed cycles and staked at Hostel-3, centre
portion, Ahalia campus and near tilang A, parking area(left corner), Nila
campus. Those cycles will be auctioned in the coming days. Hence this is
the final call for those students who have not numbered their cycles to do
so.

*English Idioms*

1. Cut to the chase

When somebody tells you to cut to the chase it means that you’ve been
talking too long and haven’t gotten to the point. When a person uses this
idiom, they’re telling you to hurry up and get to the important part,
without all the details. Be careful how you use this idiom, because if used
while talking to someone like a college professor or your boss, it’s rude
and disrespectful.

If you’re speaking to a group of people, like your employees, and say I’m
going to cut to the chase, it means that there are a few things that need
to be said but there’s very little time, so you’ll skip to the important
parts so everyone understands.

“Hi guys, as we don’t have much time here, so I’m going to cut to the
chase. We’ve been having some major problems in the office lately.”


2. Up in the air

When we literally think about something being up in the air, we have the
idea that something’s floating or flying in the sky, perhaps an airplane or
a balloon. But really if someone tells you that things are up in the air it
means that these things are uncertain or unsure. Definite plans have not
been made yet.

“Maya, have you set a date for the wedding yet?”

“Not exactly, things are up in the air and we’re not sure if our families
can make it on the day we wanted. Hopefully we’ll know soon and we’ll let
you know as soon as possible.”

3. On the ball

If you look at this phrase literally, it means to be either standing or
sitting on a ball—but who would do that?

If you’re on the ball it means that you’re very quick to understand certain
things, very prepared for something or react quickly (and correctly) to a
situation.

For example, if you’re planning an event/seminar that’s still one year away
from now and you’ve almost finished with all the planning already, you’re
definitely on the ball because not many people are that prepared!

“Wow, you’ve already finished your assignments? They aren’t due until next
week, you’re really on the ball. I wish I could be more organized.”

4. Get over something

If you think about it, it’s possible to literally get over something, for
example get over a fence—but this is not how the phrase is generally used
in the English language.

Imagine having a really difficult time, like a celebrity going through a
divorce—it’s hard. But eventually once time passes and they no longer think
about their ex, it means that they’ve gotten over him/her, or, if related
to you, you no longer worry about it and it no longer affects you in a
negative way. It’s also possible to get over an illness, which would mean
that you’ve fully recovered.

“How’s Priya? Has she gotten over the death of her dog yet?”

“I think so. She’s already talking about getting a new one.”


5. Look like a million dollars/bucks

Wouldn’t it be great if we really could look like a million dollars? We’d
be rich, but that’s not the case. If someone tells you that you look like a
million bucks, you should take it as a huge compliment because it means you
look absolutely fabulous and really attractive.

While sometimes we use this idiom for guys, it’s more commonly used to
compliment women. And while some of your female friends may look beautiful
every day, you should save this one for when they’ve really made an effort
and it’s a special occasion, like a festival celebration or a wedding.

“Wow, Farzana, you look like a million dollars/bucks this evening. I love
your hairstyle and dress!”

regards, Sandhya

Kind attention to  Students of  Nila Hostels

Dear Students,
We have received complaints regarding internet issues at Hostels in Nila
Campus.
The reason is that some students have connected untrusted rouge devices to
our network.
Those devices are causing connection issues for others in the hostels of
Nila Campus.
The rest of the network in the campus is being protected by us.
We have provided wired LAN connections to all the students. Please connect
only your laptop to these points.

To resolve this issue, please remove all the connected Access Points/
untrusted Wi-Fi routers from your rooms.

We have identified such rooms and visited them, but some of the rooms were
locked .
As per our network policy, students are not allowed to connect untrusted
rouge APs to the Institute network.

If your device does not have a LAN port, please use a RJ45 (LAN port) to
USB converter.

Thanks
With Regards,
Biju

*Reading Comprehension*

*Read the short passage and attempt the questions that follow to test your
understanding:*

Excerpt from "How do good conversations work? Philosophy has something to
say" by Stephanie Ross

British philosopher, H P Grice, noted in 1975 that successful conversation
is a cooperative enterprise rather than a series of disconnected remarks.
Certain shared
expectations are in place greasing the skids of our conversational give and
take. In particular, he announced a ‘cooperative principle’: ‘make your
conversational
contribution such as is required at the stage at which it occurs, by the
accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are
engaged.’ This principle is
observed by following four maxims: of quantity (be informative), quality
(be truthful), relation (be relevant) and manner (be clear). For Grice, we
communicate by
intending that others recognise our intentions to do so. Communication can
be undermined if we violate any or all of the maxims – if we offer less
information than is
required or too much information that distracts; if we make false claims or
claims for which we lack evidential support; if we embark on tangents; if
we formulate
obscure or ambiguous remarks; if we are prolix or disorganised.

Following Grice’s maxims helps ensure that our utterances convey the
meaning we intended. But this is far from guaranteeing conversational
success. Not only must
the speaker choose her words properly, but her conversant must be open to
receiving them. So what makes for a receptive interlocutor? It helps to be
willing,
deferential, interested, intrigued. We valorise conversations when we speak
of them as flowing. Grice’s emphasis on cooperation is crucial here. Both
parties to a
conversation must want it to succeed. He posits a structure of mirrored and
iterated intentions that facilitate conversational exchange. Working
together, conversants
can explore a subject matter or perform a task. Of course the division of
labour will never be exactly equal. But successful and satisfying
conversation results when
participants share a communicative goal, enjoy a minimal match of manner
and style, and accommodate one another’s interests, moods and needs.

1) " successful conversation is a cooperative enterprise rather than a
series of disconnected remarks." Here, enterprise means
a) a business
b) a company
c) an undertaking

2) " greasing the skids" is an idiom. It refers to
a) wooden planks used to build a track for rolling heavy objects
b) skate-like attachments for shoes
c) any action taken to move something more quickly

3) "if we embark on tangents" refers to
a) a straight line or plane that touches a curve or curved surface at a
point, but if extended does not cross it at that point.
b) a completely different line of thought or action
c) a variation of the dance, tango

4) 'accommodate' as used in the last line means
a) provide housing for
b) give someone what they need
c) bear with

5) The terms interlocutor and conversants are used in relation to
a) conversation
b) communication
c) cooperation

*Answers*
1) c
2) c
3) b
4) b
5) a

DAY 316
20/09/2022

*“YES, AND . . .” *

It is possible to disagree with someone without being disagreeable.
Practice positive communication through the “Yes, and . . .” technique.
  ♦ Throughout your day, notice if you ever want to disagree with someone.
  ♦ Consider if it is possible to integrate their perspective into your own.
  ♦ When responding, practice positive communication by saying, “Yes, and
_____,” adding your opinion to what they’ve presented rather than as a
replacement.

Dear All,


Mr.Kevin Jude Concessao  who is working with Dr. Unnikrishnan C will be
presenting his research proposal on 21st September 2022 at 02:30 PM.


Date & Time : 21st September 2022, 2:30 pm

Venue             :  Room No. 301,Samgatha , Nila Campus


Please join with the following zoom link if you are unable to participate

Abstract

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are used  extensively for analyzing
graph-structured data with higher accuracy for node classification, graph
classification, and link prediction, in areas such as social networks
(analyzing human interactions), chemistry (molecule discovery, protein
folding prediction), transportation, fast-placement of chips, etc. The
vertices and edges in the case of a GNN are associated with high
dimensional  feature vectors. The patterns of interests are often
hidden/entangled in these feature vectors. The  operations in GNNs  consist
of   data-driven, irregular, with   interleaved dense and regular neural
network operations. Hence, performance optimizations applied for graph
processing and traditional DNNs cannot be applied easily to GNNs. Several
forms of parallelism can be explored in GNNs: operator-level, feature
vector-level, graph-partition-level, model-level, etc.  Since there is a
need for studying larger and deeper GNN models, there is also the need to
accelerate and improve the performance and scalability of GNN
training/inference algorithms on heterogeneous hardware architectures. We
aim to provide GNN-specific programming abstractions for heterogeneous
hardwares. We briefly introduce how graph programming models have evolved
to process graph neural networks, and then introduce the challenges in
processing graph neural networks on heterogeneous architectures. The
presentation will conclude with an high level overview of    future work.


All are cordially invited.

Dear All,

Ms. S. Sreejyothi, MS Scholar  who is working under the supervision of Dr.
Revathy Padmanabhan, will be presenting her research seminar on 16th
September 2022 at 02:00 PM through online mode.

Title: Plasmon Enhanced Polarization Sensitive Photodetection Using
Semiconducting Monolayers

Date & Time: 16th September 2022 at 02:00 PM

Venue: Zoom meeting details are given below

Meeting ID: 930 9995 1979

Passcode:  351483

Meeting link:
https://zoom.us/j/93099951979?pwd=QlhvaFlqN3RCdUlZN1pyN01Ud2ZjQT09



ABSTRACT:



Applications of photodetectors sensitive to the circular polarization of
light (CPL) can be found in various fields of science and engineering.
Developing a compact, polarization-sensitive photodetector (PSPD) with good
responsivity is essential to fulfil the growing needs for CPL detection in
next-generation technologies. This work elucidates the design of a compact
PSPD using layered semiconductors as the optically active layer. Simple
planar metallic nanostructures are used to enhance the responsivity of the
detector, as the fabrication process flow for planar structures can be
relatively more straightforward.



Assigning chiral geometries to the nanostructure can impart polarization
sensitivity to the detector. To identify geometries that yield maximum
polarization sensitivity at the absorption peak of the photoactive
monolayer MoS2 (671nm), six different Ag plasmonic nanostructures are
designed and analyzed, initially. The shifted rod structure, with a CD of
7%, showed the highest polarization sensitivity.



Since the shifted rod geometry shows good polarisation sensitivity,
different configurations in shifted nanorod geometries are explored,
including modifying the metallic shifted rod to three different
configurations using shifted metal-insulator-metal (MIM) based rods.
Detailed simulations and analysis of the chiroptic response of each of
these configurations are performed using the absorption and reflection
spectra, electric field and surface charge distributions.



The M-I shifted rod configuration (with Ag film underneath MoS2) exhibited
high CD; this is further explored to study the effect of overlap length on
CD in MoS2, to improve the device performance. The ratio (γ) of overlap
length to length of the rod is varied, and the origin of spectral features
is understood from the charge and field distributions. The photocurrents
and the spectral responsively have been calculated as well. The electrical
analysis shows 51% more sensitivity to LCP than RCP besides the
illumination sensitivity, making it an efficient PSPD.


The poster for the research seminar is attached herewith.

All are cordially invited.

Self assessment
by Ramaswamy Krishnan Chittur - Monday, 12 September 2022, 4:44 PM
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Class:

Just wanted to check how things are going. Since we did not have a class
last Friday, please do a self-assessment on the progress – here is a
quick checklist

THEORY:

* Did you get a chance to go through the slide deck I shared, named
“SoftwareEngi”eeeringPrinciples"? That captures the core theory that we
have discussed so far.

PROGRAMMING:

Did you get a chance to try out the following code samples:

* Storage classes in XML, JSON and TXT that I mentioned in the first
class.
* The Design Patterns code sample that I shared out.
* The UX/MVVM code sample that I shared out.

 If you have not read through any of these topics, or have not tried out
these code samples yet, please do ASAP. If you have any questions, please
feel free to ask.

Thank you.

Dear All,
Hope you are in good health!
Don't forget to pay attention to your health. .
Due to unhealthy lifestyle habits, work pressure, getting infected,
problems related to digestion and other similar health issues have become
quite normal in today's world. The best part is that all these problems can
be solved by practicing simple Asanas of Yoga.

With a combination of deep breathing as well as proper body stretches
targeting abdominal organs and twists that massages and wrings out stuck
intestinal toxins, we can get rid of a wide range of digestive discomforts
(gas, bloating, acid reflux, constipation etc.).

Below I have attached a document on recommended Yoga Asanas for digestion
related issues. Hope you will find it helpful and practice them at home.


With best regards,
Sujata Priyambada Palai

Subject: Carbon Zero Challenge CZC 2022 - IIT Madras inviting application
for All India Eco-Innovation and Entrepreneurship contest
To: <deanacad@iitpkd.ac.in>


Dear Prof. Pramod S. Mehta

Greetings from IIT Madras!

We are glad to inform you that the third edition of Carbon Zero Challenge
(CZC), an All India Eco-Innovation and Entrepreneurship competition was
launched on 24 August 2022. CZC 2022 aims to accelerate the lab-to-market
transition of eco-innovations in India by funding innovations from
proof-of-concept, lab-scale solutions to working prototypes or pilots.

The Theme for CZC2022 is CZC for CRC  “Circularity in Resources
Conservation”. CZC 2022  would focus on fostering innovative solutions
incorporating circularity and sustainability for managing and conserving
the following resources - Air, Water, Soil, Materials, and Energy.

If you are working in technology/ policy/business or IT/ Data analytics
development in any of the above domains and interested in implementing your
technology in the field through entrepreneurship, we strongly encourage you
and your team to apply for CZeroC. We expect to shortlist 100 teams by
October 2022 of which  25 teams will be given prototype funding up to Rs 5
lakhs per team. The teams will be connected to experts in industry and
academia to hone their technical and business skills. The CZC winners get a
10 lakhs startup seed grant and continued support, including access to the
IITM incubation ecosystem.

Please check out our website http://www.czeroc.in for more details and the
application portal.

Why Clean Tech and Circularity?

Startups in the Cleantech/ Eco tech domain are very few but the global
challenges and demand for startups with deep tech solutions are
accelerating and opening an enormous business opportunity.  A report from
Allied Market Research states that in 2020, the global green tech and
sustainability market was valued at over $10 billion. By 2030, it’s expected to
reach over $74 billion
<https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/green-technology-and-sustainability-market-A06033>.
Across the globe, investments in green technologies hit a whopping $755
billion in 2021
<https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/040915/investing-green-technologythe-future-now.asp#toc-understanding-green-technology-investing>,
a significant increase from the previous year.

Resource Depletion accelerated by the triple planetary crisis of climate
change, pollution, and Biodiversity loss is the world's biggest challenge.
Earth overshoot day when we exhaust our annual budget for natural resources
fell on July 28th and we need 1.75 piles of earth to sustain our
consumption. It is imperative to balance our demand and the earth’s supply
through resource conservation, rethinking design, and materials to enable
the reduction, recycling, recovery, and reuse of resources. The industry
and public service systems need non-polluting technology to achieve this
carbon, land, and water footprint.

We look forward to participation from your faculty, students in your
respective research groups,  early-stage startups, and startups about to
register teams.

*****************************************************

*English Idioms* - speak and understand spoken English better

1. Sit tight

Sit tight is a great example of why you can’t translate idioms in English
word-for-word. It literally would mean that you sit down squeezing your
body in a tight way—which if you did would be very uncomfortable, not to
mention you’d look really strange.

But if a person tells you to sit tight they want you to wait patiently and
take no action until you hear otherwise.

“Priya, do you have any idea when the exam results are going to come out?”

“Who knows Ramesh, sometimes they come out quickly but it could take some
time. You’re just going to have to sit tight and wait.”

2. Pitch in

This phrase actually makes no sense if you try to take it literally.
However, figuratively speaking, it means to contribute (give) to something
or someone or to join in.

So if Mr.Samuel tells the residents of Hostel 3 that he wants everyone to
pitch in this weekend and help clear the hostel grounds, it means he wants
everyone to join in on the efforts to clear the grounds and get things done
quicker.

“What are you going to buy Ankita for her birthday?”

“I don’t know. I don’t have much money.”

“Maybe we can all pitch in and buy her something great.”

The above conversation suggests that every one of  Ankita’s friends should
contribute a little bit of money so they can afford to buy her a bigger and
better present together.


3. Face the music

In literal terms, facing the music means turning your body to the direction
of the music and standing in front of it. But if your friend or your
parents tell you to face the music, there’s a much harsher meaning.

It means to “face reality” or to deal with the reality of the situation and
accept all the consequences, good or bad (but mostly bad). Perhaps you’ve
been avoiding something because you feel unsure or scared of the outcome.
Maybe you lied to your teacher and she discovered the truth and now you
have to face the music and accept the punishment.

“I can’t understand why I failed EL 405.”

“You know you didn’t study hard, so you’re going to have to face the music
and take the course again next odd semester if you really want to graduate
with the rest of your class.”

4. Ring a bell

If we look at the literal meaning of ring a bell, it’s just that: You could
be ringing the school bell to tell students it’s time to go to class or
ringing someone’s doorbell.

But the idiom means that somebody has mentioned something that sounds
familiar to you, perhaps you’ve heard it before. In other words, when
someone says something that you believe you’ve heard in the past, bells
start ringing and you try to remember how or why that name or place sounds
familiar.

“You’ve met my friend Supriya Devarakonda, right?”

“Hmmm, I’m not sure, but that name rings a bell. Was she the one who won a
Tata Endowment for a senior-citizen care program last year?”

5. Blow off steam

In reality a person cannot blow off steam (the hot rising air from boiling
water)—only electrical equipment can, such as the electric jug (appliance
for boiling water for coffee). So what does it mean when a person blows off
steam?

If you’re feeling angry, stressed or are experiencing some strong feelings
and you want to get rid of them so you feel better again, you will blow off
steam by doing something such as exercising to get rid of the stress.

“Why is Nizam so angry and where did he go?”

“He had a fight with his brother, so he went for a run to blow off steam.”

*****************************************************

Greetings Everyone.

Hope you are doing well.


As a part of the Swachhta Pakhwada celebrations, we at EBSB would like to
educate our institute family regarding the most basic yet instrumental part
of the Swachh Bharat Mission -* proper waste management and appropriate use
of waste bins.*


I am sure all of you must have seen dustbins painted with different colours
across the street, but have you ever wondered what these colours symbolise
or why we need colour coding in the first place?

Well, the reason is not just limited to their different ways of being
recycled but also we must realise that the segregation of waste at source
is key to the success of all the options and technologies available in the
country.

The most common colour coding followed in India :



   1.

   RED * : *Non recyclable glass (window glass, mirrors), single use
   plastic (plastic

           wraps), foam materials, plastic coated cups and plates.


   1.

   YELLOW *: *Recyclable plastics, glasses, paper waste, cardboards.



   1.

   GREEN *: *Biodegradable waste, organic wastes(fruits and vegetable peels
   etc), non

                  hazardous wood waste.


   1.

   BLUE : Sometimes you may even come across these types of bins, they
   are

             generally used for disposing metals(beverage cans, machinery,
window

              frames, wire cables etc).


   1.

   BLACK *:* Ever wondered where do all the computers and other appliances
   end up

                after we discard them? Black dustbins are specifically used
for recycling

                “e-waste”, a term broadly used for all surplus electronics.


   -

   Sometimes you may not find dustbins specifically for metals or
   electronics, so just remember segregation is key. We can always put them
   in separate plastic bags so that the concerned authorities may take care of
   it.



So this Swachhta Pakhwada, let us be more responsible IITians and do our
bit to make this world a better place to live in.


For more information about the Swachh Bharat Mission and the values it
entails, refer the following link:

Dear Students,

I regret to inform you all that Mitacs (SICI) has not listed IIT Palakkad
as a member of Mitacs though the agreement was signed in 2021 and they have
somehow missed to include us. So our students are not considered this time
since their committee has to approve and then list IITPKD.

I shall follow up and make sure the IITPKD is listed. Wish you all the best.

Thanking you,

With regards

Respected sir,

Many students including me got a bugged coding question during today's
Arista coding round. There was no description nor function template nor
constraints and in the sample output irregular spacing was messing up the
test case judgment. We reported this question during the test and have
reported the issue to Yagnesh. The others who did not receive this bugged
question were able to complete the test, so I request some action to
be taken immediately.

Thanking you

Dear Students @Ahalia Hostels,
It has been found that one of the Access points kept in a class room
(Academic Block) was damaged by the students recently. In another incident,
the students have removed the access point from the installed location to a
different location in Hostel 4. They have used self-adhesive tapes to fix
the Access Points on the wall ! Had the access point not been removed by
our duty staff, that would also have been damaged.
Quite interestingly, a ticket was raised today complaining that the access
point was removed !

Such practices would not help us in any way to provide better services.
Hence, we request you to abstain from such activities and instead raise
tickets in the support portal if there are any issues.

The loss to the Institute will be restituted from the students involved in
these cases.


Assuring you of our best services at all times...

Thanks,
With Regards,
Team CET

DAY 309
07/09/2022

*MASTERFUL LIFESTYLE *

All of life’s experiences can be likened to the initiations for martial
artists. Sometimes one move must be practiced over and over and over again
until it is mastered in order to achieve one degree of initiation. A
masterful martial artist becomes so through discipline and consistency.
Laziness or complacency has no place in the life of the martial artist, who
maintains great order and commitment in daily life. Throughout your day,
hold yourself to a higher standard. Practice what you know to be true.
Become masterful.

Dear all,
Greetings!

Hope you are safe and doing well. I am delighted to announce that after a
long wait we have been successful in getting a music room in the Nila
campus. Thus, from now on, room no *201-A* in *Bageshri Hostel* will be
used as the music room.  There are particular instructions that you have to
follow if you want to access the instruments as they are very expensive and
we want you to use them carefully and responsibly as well.

Please fill out *this form* <https://forms.gle/CMrua8BaZQQVi9eY9> if you
want to access instrument/instruments for practice or are curious to learn.
In this case please note that you will not be allowed to take the
instruments outside. If you are a non-vadya member then you will be
accompanied by a vadya member throughout who is aware of using the
instrument that you want to learn.

Please fill out *this form* <https://forms.gle/uzezxkq4bssP1ffj8> if you
want to take the instruments for a specific purpose/event. In this case,
only the event coordinator or the event head should fill the form.

This is our attempt to help students explore their interest in music and I
hope you all will coordinate and cooperate with us in this initiative and
make it fruitful for you as well.

P.S: Please find the basic instructions to be followed *here*

Traditional industrial models and beliefs have driven investments towards
economies of scale in the conventional energy sector, be it mega-refineries
or massive thermal power plants. Can the same principles be applied to
sustainable energy production systems, or do we need a new paradigm of
decentralised deployment and delivery in the context of climate change?

Learning from decentralised solar energy in Europe, can a 1 barrel per day
alternate fuel plant be made economically competitive and ecologically
meaningful in India?

Joining us this Saturday, September 3, 2022 at 5.00pm is Dr Anjan Ray,
Director, CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum. He will share his dream of an
India where all fossil fuel imports would be displaced by domestic carbon
atoms and sustainable energy sources, and decentralized pursuit of the
nation’s climate goals would be practiced widely under enabling policies.

*Date:* Saturday, September 3, 2022

*Time: *5.00pm to 6.30pm (IST)

*THIS IS YOUR GENERATION *

Every individual in a generation is the cocreator of that generation’s
history.
♦ Begin your meditation by setting a timer for five minutes and getting
into a comfortable position.
  ♦ Silently repeat the statement: “I am a cocreator of my generation, and
history will remember my contributions.”
♦ When your timer goes off, stretch the body in any way that feels
comfortable for you.
  ♦ Take a deep breath and say out loud, “I am a cocreator of my
generation, and history will remember my contributions.”

Sometimes we get so engrossed with the routine work that we end up doing things mechanically and become comfortable in our current situation.

It leads to stagnancy and we continuously lose self-confidence and motivation to take up new challenges.

At the end blame game starts and it leads to more negativity.

Remember our personal growth is entirely in our own hands. We have to follow our huger of growth and keep looking for new horizons apart from our comfort zones.

You need to ask this question to yourself every day. "Am I giving my best?"

If you keep running away from this question, the answer for growth will always be going to be a ’Never’.

DAY 303
01/09/2022

*HANDWASHING MEDITATION*

 Make washing your hands a meditation.
  ♦ Take a few deep breaths and experience the temperature of the water.
  ♦ Really notice the fragrance of the soap, massaging it into your hands.
  ♦ Mindfully clean every part of the hands, between the fingers,
underneath the fingernails.
♦ Experience it all as if for the first time.

Dear all,
The badminton court at Agora is not available for play *during the evening
hours* of Monday the 5th September 2022 due to the  "Happy Hour" event
being organized by the institute library on the occasion of Teachers day.
Thank you,

See the attached photos of the Innovation lab in the Ahalia campus -- the
tables are messy, leftover food is all over the place. If you cannot use
the facility responsibly, then we will have to severely restrict entry to
the lab. Genuine users amongst the students will suffer.

Last fortnight, just as we were reopening, we found that many first year
projects had been vandalized. Parts removed, Arduino boards missing.

Similar  behaviour has been seen in the EE labs in Nila nd Ahali as well

A lot of money and effort goes into setting up and managing facilities for
you. USE THEM RESPONSIBLY.


*****************************************************

Dear Arvind,
Sorry to see how freedom and free access are misutilized by the students.
Hats off to those underserved students. We are seeing similar behavior
elsewhere in the institute as well.
The only solution is to control and monitor the entry and their use of
facilities in the innovation labs.
Thank you,
Jagadeesh

Subject: Artificial Intelligence Application Support Program for
underrepresented groups @ Oregon State University
To: <ckn@iitpkd.ac.in>


Hi Sir,


I hope things are great at Palakkad! I'm reaching out on behalf of the
Artificial
Intelligence Graduate Student Association (AIGSA) at Oregon State
University. Our organization represents the graduate student body of the AI
program here, as well as students researching artificial intelligence at
the university in general.

This year, we're launching the Artificial Intelligence Application Support
Program (AIASP), a service run by volunteer graduate students in our school
to assist folks historically underrepresented in the field as they apply to
AI graduate programs (M.S./Ph.D.) at OSU!

The program is divided into two phases:

   1.

   Graduate School Chats. In the first phase, applicants will have a
   30-minute one-on-one chat with one of our mentors. These chats will provide
   perspective to applicants wondering if graduate school is right for them,
   and demystify the application process.
   2.

   Application Feedback. In the second phase, applicants will receive early
   feedback on their Statement of Purpose and CV. They may share any
   information about their identity and research interests that they'd like
   considered when matching their application materials with a mentor for
   review.


If you think this program will benefit your undergraduate or graduate
(M.Tech) students, I would deeply appreciate you taking the time to pass it
along! You can find more information on our website at aigsa.club/aiasp
<https://www.aigsa.club/aiasp/> and register to participate with this form
https://forms.gle/dc425Z944hLm4brb7.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, comments, or
concerns; we're always happy to answer!

Best,

Skand

Dear All,

It is a pleasure to invite you for a talk by Dr. Ujjwal Maulik, a Professor
of Computer Science from Jadavpur University. The details of the talk are
provided below. The speaker will also be available for interaction post the
talk.

*Title: Single and Multi-objective Data Clustering*
*Location:* Ahalia 120
*Time:* 11.00am-12.00pm
*Abstract: *Data clustering is a popular unsupervised pattern
classification technique that is used for partitioning a given data set
into homogeneous groups based on some similarity/dissimilarity metric.
There are several single objective clustering algorithms available and
popular in the literature including KMean and FCM. Although both KMean and
FCM are very popular algorithms, they may stuck to local optima depending
on the choice of initial cluster centers. In this lecture first we will
demonstrate how Metaheuristic techniques can be used to solve the problem
of KMean/FCM. Result will be demonstrated for pixel classification of
satellite images. In the second part of the lecture we will discuss more on
Multiobjective clustering, in which multiple objective functions are
simultaneously optimized. Selecting one solution from the set of Pareto
Optimal solutions is always a critical issue. We will also discuss how
machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM) can be used
to combine the Pareto Optimal solutions to evolve a better solution. The
result will be demonstrated for classification of Micro Array Gene
Expression Data.


*Biography of the Speaker:* Dr. Ujjwal Maulik is a Professor in the Dept.
of Comp. Sc. and Engg., Jadavpur University since 2004. He was also the

Dear All,

Due to OFC break, Nila campus is cut off from Ahalia Campus. Consequently,
the following services are affected.

Internet in computer labs at Nila
License Servers
PG Portal, Joinus and Faculty portals.
Telephone Services.

However, limited Internet connectivity is available at Nila Campus through
the failover connection from Railtel.

We are working with BSNL to get the cable repaired at the earliest. The
inconvenience caused is regretted.

With regards,
Biju

*LETTERS OF HOPE *

Consider someone in your life who is going through a hard time. With love
and generosity, write a message of hope to them. When you are finished,
sign the letter, tear it up, and throw it away, imagining that the message
of hope is being released into the universe.

FORWARD TOGETHER

Dear All,

Mr. Mithulraj M  who is working with Dr. Madhu Karthik will be presenting
his research proposal on 23rd August 2022 at 03:30 PM.

Title: Fatigue response of shear critical reinforced concrete bent cap with
corroded reinforcement

Date & Time: 23rd August 2022 at 03:30 PM

Venue: Room Number 305, Samgatha, Nila Campus

Abstract

Cantilever bent caps are commonly used supporting structural elements in
elevated bridges, that are subjected to repeated loading and are exposed to
environmental conditions. During application of loads from the girder on
the overhang portion of the cantilever bent cap, tension cracks typically
form at the top face of the joint region. These cracks create a pathway for
moisture ingress into the structure, and leads to reinforcement corrosion
in the beam-column joint. Being shear critical members, corrosion of
reinforcement in the joint region could severely affect the strength and
durability performance of these structural components. In addition, the
bent caps are also subject to repeated vehicular loading, and fatigue could
be an important consideration to assess the performance of the structure.
An experimental and analytical investigation is proposed in this study, to
understand the effects of reinforcement corrosion on the strength and
durability of reinforced bridge bent caps subject to fatigue loading.
Scaled cantilever bent cap with and without reinforcement corrosion in the
joint region, will be experimentally evaluated for its fatigue performance,
load carrying capacity, ductility and mode of failure. Reinforcement
corrosion will also be incorporated into the Compatibility Strut-and-Tie
Method (C-STM), to study the progression of nonlinear events, and the
failure mechanism. The validated model will also be used to conduct a
parametric study, to understand the effects of various parameters on the
performance of bridge bent caps with reinforcement corrosion in the joint
region. Based on the experimental and analytical results, equations will be
proposed for estimating the residual shear strength of cantilever bent cap
with reinforcement corrosion. This in turn, can be used for evaluating the
residual shear capacity of existing bridge bent caps with reinforcement
corrosion in the joint region.

All are cordially invited.

*Reading Comprehension*

Read the following passage and attempt the questions that follow:

 India@75: Behaving like an Elder? by   Ashish Kothari

As India celebrates 75 years of Independence, does it embody the wisdom
such an age should bring? At least from one point of view, the answer is a
resounding NO—the sustainability of its natural environment, on which all
our lives depend.

It is astounding how we still ‘externalize’ nature in our single-minded
pursuit of economic growth. After decades of high growth, 480 million
people in northern India face the most extreme levels of air pollution in
the world. According to the NITI Aayog, “600 million people in India face
high to extreme water stress … with nearly 70% of water being
contaminated.” The Indian Space Research Organisation says that 30% of our
land is at various stages of degradation, some getting desertified. In the
markets of most cities, food has levels of pesticides well above human
safety levels. The climate crisis is threatening the livelihoods and lives
of several hundred million—mostly the poorest. Yet, the government is busy
dismantling environmental and social security policies to favor corporate
access to land and natural resources. Sixty million people have already
been displaced by ‘development’ projects; how many more?

It does not have to be like this. Thousands of initiatives are
demonstrating how basic needs including food, water, energy, housing can be
met, dignified livelihoods generated, and learning and health access
enhanced, while working with and within the natural environment, respecting
not only human rights but also the rights of fellow species to thrive (
www.vikalpsangam.org). But this requires spaces for everyone’s voice in
decision-making (a radical democracy), community control over the commons,
struggles against various inequalities including gender and caste,
sustaining diverse cultures and knowledges, and replacing GDP with
meaningful indicators of well-being … a genuine swaraj. In the last quarter
of its century of Independence, this is India’s biggest challenge. If we
fail, we will be mourning, not celebrating, in 2047.

1) As used here, 'externalize' means
a) send outside
b) an economic concept, of failing to or choosing not to incorporate as
part of a pricing structure, costs (especially social and environmental)
resulting from a product's manufacture and use.
c) give external existence or form to.

2) 'The climate crisis is threatening the livelihoods and lives of several
hundred million'. Which of the following is NOT an example of that?
a) 600 million people in India face high to extreme water stress
b)  30% of our land is at various stages of degradation, some getting
desertified
c) food has levels of pesticides well above human safety levels

3) Why does the author ask for 'replacing GDP with meaningful indicators of
well-being'?
a) GDP (gross domestic product) measures the money-value of all the goods
and services produced in a country
b) GDP fails to take note of how producing goods and services pollutes
air,water and soil
c) He has some ideas about what meaningful indicators could be

4) From the passage, it is possible to conclude that India's air and water
pollution problems show
a) we have too many people, especially poor ones
b) GDP is growing at the cost of environment
c) access to clean air and adequate water of acceptable quality for all
Indians is not being prioritised

5) 'working with and within the natural environment' can be described as
a) radical democracy
b) democracy
c) sustainability

Answers
1) b
2) c
3) b
4) c
5) c

My friend, Aiswarya H(111901006) and I want to work on a project under Dr.

a mismatch in the team allocation, we request you to allow us to work in
the same team for the project mentioned above.
We discussed the same with Koninika ma'am and she approved of it.

Warm Greetings,

It gives me immense pleasure in announcing the winners of the India Quiz.
It was an exciting affair with a lot of emotions involved. We witnessed
participants shouting with joy on answering correctly and expressing sighs
of despair upon answering incorrectly. There were moments of doubt and
nervousness while answering a question and there were also moments of sheer
confidence upon answering with absolute certainty. The final standings
are as follows:

   1. *Saket Sharan and Bikash Kumar Gupta*
   2. *Akash Brijesh and Joel Jeffrey*
   3. *Julin S and Amithabh A*
   4. *Vaibhav B Nagrale and Vinay Ingle*

Congratulations to all the winners. I would also like to wholeheartedly
thank all the participants for attending the quiz.
Please note that due to the format of the quiz, only the finalists will be
awarded leaderboard points in accordance with the guidelines, all other
participants will be awarded participation points.

I would also like to thank my fellow core team members, Paul Tony and Ravi
Chaudhary and my fellow batchmate, Shashwat Singh for assisting me in
organising this event successfully.

Hoping to see good participation in the future quizzes as well.

Regards
Kartik Gopa Kumar

Dear All,

The users of Amenity centre under the tensile roof at Nila are* requested
to handover the plates and the tea/coffee cups to the staff.* Due to the
wind gust, we are getting reports on breaking of glass utensils. Also,
broken glass utensils may cause severe injury to the people.

All the users and *in particular students, should not leave any used
plastic bottles or wrappers or food packages either in the Amenity centre
or in the surroundings. The dust bins are placed for the disposal. *I am
sure, we have a basic civic sense.

Thank you,
Jagadeesh

will remain the same and can be used for search, renewal and reservation of
books. The Web OPAC link is moved to the new website (to the home page-main

I sincerely thank Mr. Sumesh, Biju Sir (for technical assistance), Ms.
Rukshana, Mr. Sreejith(for content) and Sovan Sir(for guidance).

*Correct the sentences*

1) Initially I was thinking of the steps I had went through for coming up
to such a height.

2)  The doctors did assured them that I was completely fine, that I had a
good muscle tone, a strong cry and that I was just like any other “normal
child”.

3) Yet another year, another set of students preparing for the same exam,
everyone have only one dream, IIT!

4) I still remember the day when I first got into coaching classes for
preparing for an one-day exam.

5) India has a unique education system designed to uphold its nation’s
culture, history, values, and customs.


*Answers*

1) Initially I was thinking of the steps I had *went* through *for coming *up
to such *a height.*

 Initially I was thinking of the steps I had *gone* through *to come* up to
such *heights*.

2)  The doctors *did assured* them that I was completely fine, that I had a
good muscle tone, a strong cry and that I was just like any other “normal
child”.

The doctors* [did assure]/ [assured]* them that I was completely fine, that
I had a good muscle tone, a strong cry and that I was just like any other
“normal child”.

3) Yet another year, another set of students preparing for the same exam,
everyone *have *only one dream, IIT!

Yet another year, another set of students preparing for the same exam,
everyone *having* only one dream, IIT!

The present continuous 'ing' form of the verb is used for something that is
true at the time of speaking

4) I still remember the day when I first got into coaching classes for
preparing for *an one-day* exam.

I still remember the day when I first got into coaching classes for
preparing for a one-day exam.

'an' is used with words starting with a,e,i.o,u, *provided the word has a
vowel sound. *"one" sounds like "won" (consonant sound) so it is 'a one-day'

5) India has a unique education system designed to uphold* its nation’s*
culture, history, values, and customs.

 India has a unique education system designed to uphold [its] / [the
nation’s] culture, history, values, and customs.

Direct vs. Regular plan of Mutual Funds:

Every mutual fund has a Direct and Regular option. It is advisable to choose the direct option as the ongoing expense ratio is always lower than the Regular plan and this difference results in better returns compared to the Regular plan of the same mutual fund. The financial benefit of this can be massive in the long run.

Important Note on Direct Plans Vs. Regular Plans of Mutual Funds·

Under direct plans of mutual fund schemes, you invest directly with the mutual fund house. There is no intermediary/distributor involved. Hence, you save on intermediary costs. This reflects better returns as compared to regular plans of MF schemes.·

Under regular (or distributor) plans, you invest through a distributor or an intermediary. The fund house compensates the intermediary on our behalf. Thus cost (expense ratio) is higher for regular plans. Even though you don’t pay anything directly, the fund house does this. The result is higher costs (as can be seen in expense ratios) and lower returns.·

Apart from the expense part, everything else (portfolio of stocks, fund manager, etc.) is the same for direct and regular plans.· The difference in expenses (Ratio %) of both types can range from a few basis points (like 0.15%) to even more than a percent (like 1.1%). This might not seem like a large difference. But when you invest for the long term (say 15+ years), What looked like a small difference in percentage returns initially, would lead to a large difference of lacs(!) in the final corpus. This is due to the compounding of the additional percentage return you get when invested in direct plans.·

So by design, direct plans will always provide better returns than regular plans.· Therefore, it makes sense to invest in direct plans of mutual fund schemes. If you have been investing in regular plans, you can also switch your existing investments in regular plans to direct plans once the exit load period is over (typically 1 year for equity funds) and capital gains taxability becomes negligible.·

Switch from a regular plan to a direct plan of an MF scheme is considered redemption from a regular plan and fresh investment in a direct plan. Hence, exit load and capital gains liability may arise on redemption of such units in regular plans.

Moreover, your investment is a direct plan that will be subject to fresh lock-in, if applicable, and exit load period

Dear All,
Warm Greetings!
Similar to the previous semesters, for the next semester, we are planning
to have students elected Class Representatives. Interested students can
stand for the post and students of the concerned classes can elect their
CRs. Since students know their classmates after at least a semester of
studying with them together, we hope you would be able to elect those who
you feel would be able to represent your concerns.

*The number of CRs required is 2 from B.Tech for S3, S5 and 1 for S7 and 2
from Msc and 1 from M.Tech(Only Geotechnical 2021). Rest MTech departments
don't have any core courses this semester. *

Please note, that a minimum CGPA of 6 and no active backlogs are required
for a student to stand for the post. Also, the student should not have any
disciplinary action taken against them.

Interested students kindly fill out the form
<https://forms.gle/dBeBdKukudpoAiR57>.

* Deadline to fill the form: 3rd August 2022 at 12 pm.   *

*A class committee is a platform where you can directly express your
concerns to the course instructors. Hence please give this a serious
thought. If you are someone capable of presenting student concerns well, do
stand for the post and represent your class.*

<https://yourdost.com/?yd_source=IITPKD_NL&yd_medium=IITPKDMailer&yd_campaign=SignsYouCouldBeOverwhelmed>

“Ugh, these headaches just keep getting worse”, “Why do I feel like I’m all
over the place?”, “Wait, why did I come to this room? What am I forgetting?"

Do you often experience multiple feelings together and you can't control
them? If so, chances are you could be feeling overwhelmed emotionally and
it’s okay.

Since the pandemic onset, nearly *62%* of people feel overwhelmed and it
led to stress, anxiety, loss of appetite and constant worrying, as per a
2021 study.

So before that “Sigh! I feel too much at once” begins to affect your life,
how about you take a pause and check these signs?
*“I’m unable to focus”*
Lowered concentration and increased apathy can be a result of overwhelming
thoughts. This also increases the stress hormone, cortisol levels, which as
per doctors, affects memory.
*“Falling asleep is a tough task”*
A study showed that 93% of Indians suffer from sleep deprivation due to
stress. If you find yourself ruminating over thoughts during sleep time, it
can be another sign.
*“This is not how I usually behave”*
Feeling moody, irritable, and withdrawn could be a sign of you feeling
emotionally drained due to overwhelming emotions felt throughout the day,
as per experts.
*“I’m good for nothing”*
Being overly self-critical, self-judgmental and having increased negative
self-talk is a sign of internalizing the feeling of being overwhelmed as
per psychologists.
With work, family and personal needs, feeling overwhelmed can be
inevitable. But, as long as you keep a tab on signs and find the root cause
of the overwhelming emotions, prevention becomes easy.

Why not get in touch with our experts and discover more?

*Reading Comprehension*

Sniffer dog Tucker uses his nose to help researchers find out why a killer
whale population off the northwest coast of the United States is on the
decline. He searches for whale faeces floating on the surface of the water,
which are then collected for examination. He is one of the elite team of
detection dogs used by scientists studying a number of species including
right whales and killer whales.

Conservation canines are fast becoming indispensable tools for biologists
according to Aimee Hurt, associate director and co-founder of Working Dogs
for Conservation, based in Three Forks, Montana. At the time of writing, so
many new conservation dog projects have sprung up that Hurt can no longer
keep track of them all. Her organization’s dogs and their handlers are
fully booked to assist field researchers into 2012.

“Dogs have such a phenomenal sense of smell”, explained Sam Wasser,
director of the Center for Conservation Biology at the University of
Washington in Seattle. He has worked with scat-detection dogs since 1999.
Scientists have been using Conservation Canines in their research since
1999. These dogs have enabled them to non-invasively access vast amounts of
genetic and physiological information which is used to tackle conservation
problems around the world. Such information has proved vital for
determining the causes and consequences of human disturbances on wildlife
as well as the actions needed to mitigate such impacts.

The ideal detection dog is extremely energetic with an excessive play
drive. These dogs will happily work all day long, motivated by the
expectation of a ball game as a reward for sample detection. The obsessive,
high energy personalities of detection dogs also make them difficult to
maintain as pets. As a result, they frequently find themselves abandoned to
animal shelters, facing euthanasia. The program rescues these dogs and
offers them a satisfying career in conservation research.

(a) According to the text there are a few________ detection dogs like
Tucker.
1) faeces
2) scat
3) indispensable tool

(b) The ideal detection dog ________
1) is extremely energetic with an excessive play drive.
2) is abandoned in an animal shelter
3) loves ball games

(c) The dogs expect________ as a reward for their hard work.
1) a decent meal
2) a friendly human handler
3) a ball game

(d) The ________of these dogs make it difficult to keep them as pets.
1) phenomenal sense of smell
2) obsessive, high energy personalities.
3) liking for whales

(e) These dogs find career in ________
1) elite teams
2) genetic and physiological information generation
3) conservation research

(f) The word ‘euthanasia’ means ________
1) painless killing
2) youth in asia
3) inactive retirement

*Answer Key*
a)-2, b)-1, c)-3, d)-2, e)-3, f)-1

Dear All,

            As you are aware there has been a new parking area created in
the permanent campus (as soon as you enter through the gate on your left)
and therefore to effectively utilise the parking spaces available in both
the Nila and Permanent Campus and to maintain orderly parking, the
following regulations are now put in place.

1. All students and visitors must necessarily park their vehicles in the
parking lot in the permanent campus. *No vehicles from students/visitors
will be permitted to park in the Nila campus*, although visitors' vehicles
are allowed entry into Nila campus strictly for pick-up/drop of guests.

2. Faculty and staff members are required to park their vehicles at Nila
campus only in the four designated parking lots (opposite Samgatha, near
Bhagyashree, opposite Tilang and near Shikharam). *No parking is allowed in
front of Manogatha and Kaapi buildings *or any other buildings within the
campus.

3. Any faculty/staff member *who is unable to get a parking space in Nila
campus must park their vehicles in the parking area at the permanent campus*.


Kindly follow the regulations and co-operate with the security on campus to
ensure that there are no untoward incidents. These regulations will be in
force with effect from *August 8, 2022 (Monday)*.

Dear All,

Dr P Muhammed Shafi, Assistant Professor, Department of Physics, VIT-AP,
will give a talk (online) on 04 August 2022 at 2:00 p.m. All are cordially
invited to the talk. The Zoom meeting link and the title and abstract are
given below:

*Title*: Sr-and Fe-substituted LaMnO3 Perovskite: Fundamental insight and
possible use in asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor

*Abstract*: The symmetry or structural stability of ABO3-type perovskite
oxides depends largely on the size of ‘A’ and ‘B’ cations, which determines
the material properties. The partial substitution of these cations may be
used to tune these properties. The ionic sizes and valence states of the
cations play an important role in improving the properties of perovskite.
Particularly, the substitution of La3+ with Sr2+ with a larger ionic radius
and Mn3+ with Fe3+ with a similar ionic radius favored both the crystal
symmetry and the mixed ionic-electronic conductivity of the perovskite.
Electrodes based on La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 (LSMFO55) exhibited a faradaic
behavior with a specific capacity of 330 C g-1(92 mAh.g-1) at 12C rate,
while this electrode maintained a capacity of 259 C g-1 at 240C (charge or
discharge in 15s).  Additionally, exohedral carbon nano-onions (CNO)
were  introduced
as a negative electrode to design an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor (AHS)
with a widened cell voltage. The use of CNO as a negative electrode in the
AHS improved the rate capability drastically compared to the use of rGO.
This device maintained a good energy density even at an extra-high charging
rate (600C) owing to its outstanding rate capability. The high-rate
performance of the LSMFO55//CNO AHS can be elucidated by successful
fabrication with a mixed ionic-electronic conductive positive electrode and
a CNO negative electrode. Tuning the electronic and ionic conductivities by
cationic substitution and the introduction of CNO negative electrodes can
provide a practical high-rate hybrid device using various perovskites.

Dear All,

On August 6, 2022, Zoom will be retiring Zoom Client versions below 5.3.0
for Zoom Client for Meetings, Zoom Rooms, Zoom Phone, and SDK (5.4.0)  to
address a critical security vulnerability.

*Some of our users  are using client versions below 5.3.0, and those need
to be updated by August 6, 2022. Any Zoom clients that have not been
updated by August 6 will not be able to join meetings via the Zoom Client
for Meetings and will be prompted to update or join from a Web browser. *

To take advantage of all the latest security and functionality features of
Zoom, we always recommend updating users to the latest version, which is
currently 5.11.3.

Thanks
With regards,
Biju

c) drop

*Answers*
1. count
2. sometimes
3. both (see note)
4. a
5. mass noun
6. countable
7. uncountable
8. in a restaurant
9. measure words
10. grain


Note:
Can we use hairs?
We can use both hair and hairs but *in certain contexts.* Using either word
correctly is the important thing

When you want to use hairs, you should be talking about
* individual strands of hair.*
Here are some of the examples:
The tea they served me at the new canteen had 3 grey hairs in it.
(Individual strands)
His white hairs are clearly seen.

Use hair when you want to refer to *a collection of hair as a mass*. It is,
therefore, used as a collective noun here (and most commonly).

Examples:
1. I just washed my hair.
2. Your hair is looking beautiful.
3. My mother’s hair is turning white.

In the above sentences, hair is used as an uncountable collection of
strands of hair as a mass.

Similarly, 1. uncountable noun: Noise is a loud or unpleasant sound. · 2.
countable noun: A noise is a sound that someone or something makes.

When we talk about the amount of time (number of hours/days etc.) required
to complete something, time is usually uncountable.

1. How much time do we need to paint the walls? (NOT How many time do we
need…?)
2. We took quite some time to put the child to bed.
3. Hurry up – we haven’t got enough time.
4. The project was a complete waste of time and money.

When we talk about clock times, or the number of times something was done,
time is countable.

1. Five o’clock would be a great time to start.
2. I called him at various times yesterday.


regards, Sandhya

*****************************************************

Dear Students,

 1)  Please note that in some PME courses the number of students allowed
may be restricted. This would be the case with Software Engineering,
Machine Learning, Information Retrieval and may be some other courses as
well, depending on the course instructor's decision. Keeping this in mind,
if you are not sure about the course faculty accepting your
pre-registration request, it would be wise to* pre-register for one
additional choice* *of PME and GCE*. You can drop your least preferred one
during the next phase of registration.
 2) You are not supposed to choose an elective with a significant overlap
(say more than 40%) with the content of another course which you have
credited or currently going to credit.
3) It is your responsibility to make sure that you meet the prerequisites
specified in the course syllabus.

Thanks and Regards
Jasine

Head of the Department,
Computer Science and Engineering,
Indian Institute of Technology Palakkad.

Hey there!

No matter how much ever frustrating it might turn out for us to stay at
home all locked down, it is necessary for our own safety but difficult at
the same time. However, it has also opened doors to utilizing self-time,
which gets us to "hobbies- the perfect way to embrace solitude at this time!

If we were to think honestly, we would be pondered upon questions such as
why exactly have we been doing this? Or how many of us have invested our
time in something that we really love doing? Have we explored much beyond
our TV sets or our social media pages? The guilty look on our face says it
all.

But what if someone told you, that plunging into your hobby, can have an
amazing impact on your mental health.

According to the National Health Service, learning a new skill is among the
top five tips for mental well being. Having a hobby brings in a sense of
achievement and increases your sense of confidence.

Read on, your hobbies have far more positive impacts on your mind than you
know.
*1. A Happier You*

Hobbies provide you with immediate stress relief. It is the key to a longer
and happier life. Hobbies help to cut down on the stress hormone Cortisol,
which is responsible for factors like fat accumulation and hormonal
imbalance.
*2. Gets You In An Upbeat Mood*

People who actively engage in a hobby of their choice, have lower levels of
negative feelings.
*3. Improves Your Social Skills:*

Now, who would not want that. Hobbies give you something new and
interesting to talk about yourself. Investing your time in a hobby with
like-minded people will help you make more friends and ward off feelings of
social awkwardness and anxiety.
*4. Amaze People With Your Memory:*

Engaging in an activity of your choice or simply reading a book you like,
helps to protect your mind. By challenging your mind, not only you improve
your memory and problem-solving skills, but also prevent dementia in later
life.
*5. Have An Uncluttered Mind:*

Engaging in an activity of your choice helps you concentrate better.
Hobbies act as mental stimulators and in turn train your mind to
concentrate better. Hobbies improve the cognitive function of your brain.

So what's stopping you, go ahead and do what makes you happy!

We understand that it is a tough time and our experts are always here to
help you 24*7.

Hi all,
The new cdc verification folder was created because the previous folder was
shared with every cdc coordinator but now it has been modified. Now only
cse coordinators are able to access your data. The link to the new drive is
here
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AatJD6nzisPRJ0vYbColwvh0d-gQl7au>.
And don't remove the existing data in the folder which is used in

Dear All,
A technical seminar as per the details mentioned below is being conducted
by the Department of Mechanical Engineering. *All are welcome to attend.*

Topic: *Micro-swimmers - Fabrication, Actuation, Sensing and Collective
Behaviour*
Date/Time: *Aug 2, 2022 (Tuesday) 11:00 AM*
Venue: Room No. *203/204, Samagatha, Nila Campus*
*Video conferencing details:*
Zoom link :

ID: 935 9975 8408
Passcode: 376313
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Abstract of the talk:*

Inspired by the mechanisms of microscopic natural systems such as bacteria
and cells, researchers in the past two decades have tried to build
synthetic devices that are able to function with the same level of complexity.
However, the conventional design and actuation principles applicable at
macroscopic scales are not directly translatable to micro and nano scales.
There are no “off-the shelf” parts that could be assembled to make a fully
functional machine that is smaller than a grain of sand. Researchers have
made intricate static structures through micro-nano fabrication techniques,
however functional dynamic machines that have been developed so far are
still elementary compared to what nature has achieved. At these small
length scales, the physical mechanisms governing motion and actuation are
different from larger length scales. This gives us an opportunity to
explore new physics and develop new technologies for powering, actuating
and sensing with dynamic small-scale devices.

In this talk, I would discuss fabrication and wireless powering of mobile
microrobots (micro swimmers) that demonstrate controllable motion in
fluids, when actuated by external light or magnetic fields or through
self-propulsion.1 I would further discuss strategies to integrate sensors
to micro-swimmers. I would then demonstrate applications of swimmer-sensor
hybrid in quantum metrology of external magnetic and temperature fields and
cancer cell targeting.2 Then, we would learn about how multiple
micro-swimmers interact with each other and collectively act in a swarm to
influence the bulk viscosity and surface tension of the swimmer-fluid
suspension.3,4 This leads to development of new materials based on
micro-swimmers, specifically an activity controlled opto-rheological
medium, whose viscosity could be reversibly changed with light.3 Finally, I
would present an alternative strategy of microscale actuation with
out-of-equilibrium fluids and  discuss nanoscale analogues of  macroscale
mechanisms.

Dear all,
Greetings from the cultural council!

Hope you are safe and doing well. The council is glad to announce that we
are starting a repository for the cultural council where activities related
to all the clubs and other cultural events will be stored and made
available to the student community. It will be constantly updated once any
event/activity/workshop is done. Feel free to access it for viewing the
entries and relevant photos and videos related to the cultural activities.

Kindly note that the repository link will be available in each club's
Whatsapp group's description and in the sac portal under the cultural
section soon apart from this mail for convenient access.

Please find the link of the *Cultural Repository*

Dear All,

                Since one of the cables connected between the substation
and feeder pillar provided near the playground has become out of order,
there will be a *shutdown of power supply* to this feeder pillar from *1.00pm
to 3.00pm tomorrow (08.07.22) *as part of inspection and rectification
activities. This feeder pillar is feeding supply to ground lights, four
temporary labs near ground, EWD office and CPWD office. The UPS provided in
the temporary labs are having 30 mins backup only. It is therefore
requested that the faculty and research scholars of Sangraha block
judiciously use the UPS during the period.

Regards,

Ganesh

were conducted. I thank the previous club heads and our faculty mentor for
their sincere efforts and setting such a high standard from the very
beginning.

DAY 231
31/05/2022

*GOOD/BAD VERSUS ORDERLY/DISORDERLY*

 Practice nonjudgment by opening your mind to seeing things beyond
judgmental analysis with a sense of curiosity and nuance. A few examples of
mindful spectrums of analysis are:
  ♦ Mature/immature
♦ Knowledgeable/ignorant
  ♦ Orderly/disorderly What are some things that you think of as “bad”?
Would it be possible to consider the possibility that they are actually the
result of immaturity, ignorance, or disorder? Journal your reflections on
this.

*EXERCISE FOR SEEING THINGS DIFFERENTLY *

♦ Get into a comfortable position, close your eyes, and take a few deep
breaths to relax.
  ♦ Rub your hands together and then hold them over your eyes.
  ♦ Notice the warmth of your hands through your eyelids.
  ♦ Imagine that the energy from your hands is healing your eyes,
recalibrating your vision, and opening your perspective.
♦ Take a few deep breaths with your hands over your eyes. Repeat a few
times, allowing yourself to become more and more relaxed and more open to
“seeing” things differently.

Read the short passage and answer the questions that follow, to test your
comprehension

*Lost Cities*

For thousands of years, humans have built cities. Some of our oldest cities
have managed to maintain pieces of their original characteristics. Other
cities have disappeared completely. Devastation from war, famine, disease,
and natural disasters has caused many cities that were once bustling
centers of civilization to vanish completely.

One of these lost cities belonged to the Anasazi (pronounced
"an-uh-SAH-zee") people. The Anasazi lived in Chaco Canyon in New Mexico.
They built dwellings along the river that ran through the canyon. For close
to 300 years, the Chaco Canyon was the population centre of many desert
cities. Now, nothing is left of this busy city but ruins. Scientists
speculate that drought may have made the Anasazi's food scarce or that some
kind of disease killed off many of the people. However, no one knows
for sure what happened to the people of the Chaco Canyon.

Another lost city sits high atop the Andes Mountains in Peru: the city of
Machu Picchu (pronounced "MA-choo PEE-choo"). It was once among the most
powerful cities in South America, because it was home to the Incan emperor.
In 1527, its citizens packed up their belongings and moved for unknown
reasons. Scientists guess that smallpox, a disease brought by European
explorers, was the cause of Machu Picchu's downfall. Today, tourists from
all over the world climb thousands of steep stone steps to view the ruins
of this formerly majestic city.

Yet another city that is no more was called Pompeii (pronounced "pom-PAY").
This was one of the wealthiest cities of ancient Italy. This beautiful
seaside city was a lively center of commerce and trade. However, Mt.
Vesuvius was lurking in the distance. Eventually, a storm of lava, smoke,
and ash buried the city of Pompeii, putting an end to its prosperity.
Scientists have excavated and studied the ruins of Pompeii, which led to
new discoveries about ancient civilizations of Europe.

Humans have always built cities as hubs for trade, business, and family
life. Cities that have been lost provide information about the past,
helping to inform our future. By
studying lost cities, we can learn how to preserve our current cities.

1) Which of the following statements provides the best summary of the
passage?

A. Cities of the past and present look different from one another.
B. Several great cities have fallen in history.
C. Ancient cities are shrouded in mystery.
D. Humans built cities thousands of years ago.


2) In paragraph 2, the author describes the Anasazi people of the Chaco
Canyon in New Mexico. These people most likely “built dwellings along the
river that ran

through the canyon” because

A. the Anasazi utilized the river to transport goods using boats
B. the riverbank was the safest place to build homes
C. it was difficult to find food without the river
D. water is an important resource


3) According to the passage, the city of Machu Picchu was among the most
powerful cities in South America because

A. it was home to the Incan emperor
B. it was nestled high atop the Andes Mountains
C. powerful European explorers founded the city
D. tourists flocked to climb the steps to the city


4) Which of the following statements best summarizes the similarities and
differences between the three cities the author examines?

A. All of the cities were “lost,” but the ruins of each reflect a unique
civilization and geographic region.
B. Each city was founded by native people long ago, although one of the
cities was eventually “lost” by its founders.
C. All three cities were competitors in the world trade market of their
time, but only one city is still thriving today.
D. These cities were all destroyed by natural disasters, however,
scientists were only able to uncover ruins from one.


5) In the final paragraph, the author suggests that we should

A. get information about how to build thriving cities for a competitive
world
B. figure out how to protect our cities from disease and famine
C. learn from the past to ensure that we do not lose cities in the years to
come
D. learn about certain customs of ancient civilizations that can be used
today

How do we describe ourselves when it comes to our goals and qualities?
Ambitious, creative, etc, right?

But what about our bodies, romantic relationships, sexual desires, and
preferences?

Experts say that sexuality is a crucial part of who we are and it's
important to ask the right questions so we remain responsible and build
meaningful bonds.

However, it isn’t easy and we know it. A study showed more than* 75%* of
young adults wish to discuss such issues openly but are often frowned upon.

That’s why we bring you a safe space wherein you can understand sexuality,
its impacts, learn how to express yourself, and be an ally to others’
choices by means of interactive activities and quizzes!

*"Understanding Sexuality: A Choice?"*

Simulations on 15th Sep @3:30pm
To: <d.jagadeesan@iitpkd.ac.in>
Cc: <istem.india@gmail.com>


Dear all,

Greetings from I-STEM,

You are cordially invited to "Talk to Experts" on *15th September 2022
(Thursday), at 3.30 PM (IST)*

Speaker: Dr.Vinay Kariwala, Head of Business Development, SankhyaSutra Labs
Bangalore.

*Topic: Lattice Boltzmann Method for High-Fidelity Simulations*

*Abstract:* Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has played an important role
in the design of products and processes over past several decades. Entropic
Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is an emerging technique for high-fidelity
aerodynamics and multi-physics simulation. LBM achieves high levels of
accuracy and reliability, and scales linearly with the available
computational power. In this talk, we will provide an overview of
innovations embedded in SankhyaSutra’s LBM technology. We will also
demonstrate the potential of LBM using multiple examples from various
industries including Aerospace & Defense, Automobile, Process and
semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract:

Active matter consists of objects that can convert internal or ambient
sources of energy into systematic motion. Experimentally studied active
matter includes living systems such as flocks of birds, schools of fish,
swimming bacteria, migrating cells and molecular motors, as well as
synthetic non-living examples such as vibrated granular matter,
self-propelled colloids, and swimming microrobots. These systems have
received a lot of attention in recent years because they exhibit various
forms of self-organization and collective behaviour. After a general
introduction to the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of active systems,
I will discuss some of the results of our recent studies of glassy
behaviour in dense active matter. In several biological systems, such as
bacterial cytoplasm, cytoskeleton-motor complexes and epithelial sheets of
cells, self-propulsion or activity is found to fluidize a state that
exhibits characteristic glassy features in the absence of activity. The
occurrence of an active glass transition has also been observed in recent
experiments on dense systems of Janus colloids. To develop a theoretical
understanding of these non-equilibrium phenomena, we have studied the
effects of activity in several model glass-forming liquids. Our analytic
and numerical results show that dense active matter brings together the
physics of glass, jamming and plasticity in an internally driven classical
system.

Hello B'19,

Our juniors are concerned in learning Competitive Programming, Web
Development and Game Development and lack the support of a mentor to guide
them in their learning process. Therefore, the Technical council came up
with an idea of providing personal mentorship to them from our batch
students(as mentors).

We will soon be releasing self-study curriculums containing topics related
to each community ( GameDev, WebDev, CP, ML etc. ) and resources from where
to learn that specific topic in an organized manner to all the students.
Selected mentors will be helping the self-studying students (from the
curriculums) in cases when they're stuck.

I call for the students who are good in CP or GameDev or WebDev to sign up
for the mentor role by filling this form

“Choppy movement in the broader market is expected and it is likely to face resistance near 15700 marks and on downside 15000 may act as the key support level. The near-term market trend is weak and we can expect the level of 14700 in near term. One may look for good quality stocks for the long-term perspective and invest in good large caps stocks as it has been that in an inflationary environment large-caps stocks have outperformed,” said Akhilesh Jat.

2 years back The covid pandemic came with a sudden shock of compulsory lockdown for weeks, sudden mass hospitalization, reduction in salary and business income, and the worst was job loss and losing loved ones. The whole world had witnessed these events in some or the other way. It was really a hard time for all of us but especially women had witnessed its bitterness much more.

Because of a slowdown in economic activity and a complete lockdown for weeks resulted in the stoppage of active production for some companies, the demand for goods and services had reduced, the supply chain got disturbed and it all resulted in losses for the companies, and because of this companies had to cut their salaries or reduce their workforce. Surprisingly women employees were asked to leave the organization more than men employees and this leads many women to lose their job in this pandemic. Some have to leave their job to take care of their family members who fell sick in this pandemic.

Some are fortunate to get back the employment post things became normal but still, a majority of men and women are still unemployed so for them managing household expenses is really a worry.

Following pointers must be helpful for you if you are one of those in this difficult situation.

1. Make a monthly budget and compulsorily stick to it. If you were contributing to monthly household expenses and now because of no income it is better to make sure that your following the budget and sticking with essential spending each month.

2. Make sure that you are not using your emergency fund for any discretionary expenses. You have to postpone such spending till you regain employment.

3. Make a note of the next 6 months' compulsory expenses including medical expenses. Then check what total savings you have currently which is liquid means not deployed for your long-term goals. If you feel that your liquid amount is less than covering the next 6 months' expenses then pause your SIPs and other investments till things turn positive for you.

4. If your emergency fund seems short then you may liquidate investments that you were doing for any short-term financial goals. But never liquidate the investments for any ad hoc or impulsive purchases.

5. But if you already have a saving which is quite more than the emergency fund in that case you should continue funding your SIPs if you are doing it for the long term.

6. Last but not least start searching aggressively for a new job and meanwhile, look for any freelancing work available as per your skill and qualification.

Dear Prof. Sunil Kumar,

*Sub:* Seeking urgent action: Call for participation in EMPOWER 2022
Assistive Technology Conference – Reg.

I am seeking your help. It is our strong belief that India can become a
leader in Assistive Technology and Geriatrics (technology for people with
disabilities and for senior citizens) if we in academia join hands
together. We request you to encourage interested faculty, students and
start-ups at your Institution to participate in this endeavour.

Towards this, IIT Madras Research Park (IITMRP) is joining the organisers
of EMPOWER Assistive Technology Conference in hosting *EMPOWER 2022 from
13th to 15th October 2022 *at IITMRP (Chennai, India).

We welcome your colleagues and students to submit research papers to the
Conference. The paper submission guidelines can be found in the conference
website *(**https://empower2022.in/* <https://empower2022.in/>*)**.* The
conference will have paper presentations, workshops and product display by
startups and others. Exhibitors will also get a time slot for presentation
of their products. (There will be no charge for the exhibition space).

Kindly request interested students/faculty to fill out the registration
form available at *https://empower2022.in/* <https://empower2022.in/> before
July 31st, 2022.

Looking forward to your support.

DAY 271
12/07/2022

*IMPERIUM *

Mindfulness practices help us establish a sense of power or authority over
our automatic behaviors, developing a greater sense of confidence and
self-control. Meditate for at least five minutes, silently repeating the
mantra “Imperium,” which means “power” or “authority.” When the mind
wanders, come back to the mantra. With each exhale, allow a wave of
relaxation to pass through every part of the body, as if each exhale is
establishing greater power throughout every part of your being.

DAY 307
05/09/2022

*REVERENCE INSIGHT MEDITATION*

 Reverence is deep respect for the sacred, and from a mindfulness
perspective, all beings and all things are worthy of reverence.
  ♦ Take a few minutes to meditate and set a timer for at least five
minutes.
  ♦ Ask yourself, “What does it mean for me to be reverent?”
  ♦ Notice your mind’s natural response. Breathe and take your time.
  ♦ Ask again, “What does it mean for me to be reverent?”
  ♦ Allow the body to be relaxed as you continue to ask the same question,
observing the many ways your mind will respond.

Title: Development of a novel adaptive feedback-based system for the passive
control of rail bridge vibration

Date & Time: 19th May 2022 at 02:30 PM
Venue: Zoom meeting details are given below
Meeting ID:   945 8297 5396
Passcode:     935879
Meeting link:
https://zoom.us/j/94582975396?pwd=bEhDN082MHZWVy9XZmFtMkJ2VHpVQT09

ABSTRACT :

This study investigates the multiple tuning requirements of rail bridge
girder and offers the design of a novel passive adaptive control mechanism
providing the optimum tuning effect in various situations causing system
modifications. In the first part of the study, a generalized stepwise
formulation is established for designing an optimum
multiple-tuned-mass-damper (MTMD) system in the modal space of a continuous
bridge girder for controlling a selected set of modes. The numerical simulation
of a real-life steel rail bridge girder using OpenSees shows that the
MTMD system
provides unsatisfactory results in case of a detuned condition while
subjected to ground excitations with strong vertical components. Therefore,
a passive conical spring based tuned-mass-damper (TMD) system is proposed
theoretically along with a feedback-amplifier. The principle and design of
the conical spring, dampers and the feedback-amplifier system are presented
for providing optimum tuning at variations in the system inertia while
subjected to dynamic excitations. In order to realize the performance of
the control system, the same rail bridge girder is considered along with
the proposed control system after modelling it numerically in OpenSees. A
dynamic interaction study is conducted for selecting the feedback- amplifier
properties. The selected mass points for designing the proposed control
system are justified based on a time settlement analysis. Comparative
assessment is carried out considering the response time history
performances of total four control systems, namely, system 1, which is the
proposed control system assembly; system 2, in which the TMD is optimally
tuned to the primary structure with full train-load; system 3, in which the
TMD is optimally tuned to the primary structure without train- load; and
system 4, in which the optimal TMD design is accomplished considering
a weighted
combination of the transfer functions of the primary structure at both
the train-load
conditions. Results from the analysis demonstrate that the proposed control
system can be successfully designed to remain optimally tuned for modifications
in the dynamic system properties and thus, the control system provides
significant
response reduction of the primary structure at all the designed load conditions
although the conventional MTMD system suffers from the performance degradation
whenever there is a variation in the conforming loading condition.



All are cordially invited.

*****************************************************

*Read the passage provided and answer the questions that follow*

The amount of CO2 in our atmosphere is actually quite small: nitrogen and
oxygen make up 99 per cent of the atmosphere, and argon and other gases
another 0.9 per cent. But a little bit of CO2 goes a long way. There are
currently 418 parts per million (ppm) of CO2 molecules in our atmosphere –
that is, just four 1,000ths of what we breathe. Nonetheless, this is almost
50 per cent higher than pre-industrial levels; in 1800, atmospheric CO2
stood at 280 ppm.

The last time CO2 levels were this high was 5 million years ago, at the end
of the Miocene epoch. CO2 was then between 400 and 500 ppm, creating a
world quite different from the one we inhabit – with no ice at the poles
and global sea levels 50 to 100 feet higher than today. Bring back these
sea levels and half of Florida disappears. So do our coastal cities:
London, New York, Cairo and Venice. Each would become a new version of the
Lost City of Atlantis – unless hidden behind a seawall.

If Miocene Earth had the same amount of CO2 in the atmosphere as we have
currently, why aren’t we living in the same conditions? It’s a matter of
time lags: there’s a delay as the climate equilibrates with the amount of
CO2 in the atmosphere. The planet will eventually catch up. A Miocene
climate is coming. It’s like seeing the flash of a far-off explosion, but
the shockwave hasn’t yet reached us.


1. The amount of CO2 in our atmosphere is actually quite small. But a
little bit of CO2 goes a long way.
This means that
1) CO2 in our atmosphere can travel long distances
2) CO2 in our atmosphere is very high
3) The impact that a little CO2 can have is serious
4) We need not worry about the little CO2 in the atmosphere

2. What is almost 50 per cent higher than pre-industrial levels?
1) pollution
2) all gases
3) CO2 in the atmosphere
4) nitrogen

3. Epoch in the passage means
1) a period of time in history
2) a date and time from which a computer measures system time
3) a million years
4) a billion years

4. Which would you 'pair' among Florida, London, New York, Cairo and Venice
a) New York and London
b) London and Cairo
c) Cairo and Venice
d) Florida and New York
1) (a) and (b)
2) (b) and (c)
3) (c) and (a)
4) (b) and (d)

5. A Miocene climate is coming.This would mean
a) no ice in the Arctic or Antarctic circles
b) some highly populated cities will be under sea level
c) sea levels will rise by 50 to 100 feet.
d) cities will need to have sea walls
1) only (c)
2) both (c) and (d)
3) (b), (c) and (d)
4) (a), (b), (c) and (d)

6. Pre-industrial in the passage means
1) before the invention of the wheel
2) before the invention of the steam engine
3) before electricity
4) before the Ford Motor Company



*Answer Key*
1-(3), 2-(3), 3- (1), 4- (4) [2 capitals and 2 American cities], 5-(4), 6-
(2)

In meditation, something is only a distraction if you deem it as such.
Allow everything to be as it is, cultivating a sense of equanimity. We
eliminate distractions by allowing them to become part of the meditation

Dear Sir,
I have found one Samsung mobile charger (picture attached) from Room No.
303 of Samagatha Block, Nila campus while doing the Invigilation duty. I am
requesting you to inform others, so that the concerned person can get it by
contacting myself on 6289011809 or drop me an email.

Thank you
with regards
Soumik

Dear All,

Due to OFC break, Nila campus is cut off from Ahalia Campus. Consequently,
the following services are affected.

Internet in computer labs at Nila
License Server
Resap, Joinus and Faculty portals.
Telephone Services.

However, limited Internet connectivity is available at Nila Campus through
the failover connection from Railtel.

We are working with BSNL to get the cable repaired at the earliest. The
inconvenience caused is regretted.

With regards,
Biju

“We are like the little branch that quivers during a storm, doubting our
strength and forgetting we are a tree - deeply rooted to withstand all of
life's upheavals.” *~ Dodinsky*

“Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” “Have you any idea what you’re
going to do with your life?” “You’re <insert your age>, it’s high time you
start planning your future.” - Ugh, there’s so much pressure to have it all
figured out and it only gets worse as we grow up.

The annoying part is that it just stops there. No one seems to have the
answer to “How exactly do I do that?” But maybe there’s something that you
can do to start the process? Yes, it’s a narrative exercise called the
“Tree of Life”.

Would you like to give it a shot? Here are the steps:
*Draw a Tree of Life*
The first step is to let loose your hidden inner artist. Don’t worry, it’s
not a competition and no one’s judging. So set yourself free!

Do you have an A3 sized sheet of paper and some colours lying around? Go
fetch them. Can’t find any? No worries, just stick a few sheets together
and use a pen/pencil instead.

Now draw a tree with the following parts:

*Roots: *Identify YOUR roots and label them with answers to -

   - Where do you come from? (Place you were born, education, people,
   ideas, traditions, belief, language etc)
   - How important are your roots to you and has their perception changed
   over time?
   - Does your past influence you?

*Ground: *Label the ground by identifying your current reality -

   - Where do you live and what are the activities you are engaged in daily
   life?
   - Is your ground flat or bumpy? (Stable or uncertain)
   - Do you have a favourite place that you visit?

*Trunk: *Label the trunk by identifying your skills and values -

   - What talents and coping skills do you have?
   - What do you believe you are good at?

*Branches: *Label the branches by identifying your hopes and goals -

   - What’d you aspire to become?
   - Do you wish for health, family, financial stability, happiness or all?
   - How achievable are your goals?

*Leaves: *Label the leaves by identifying people who’re significant in your
life -

   - People who play an important role in your life
   - Are they still with you or leaves in the wind?
   - What influence do they have on you?

*Flowers: *Label the flowers by identifying things that make you happy -

   - What makes you smile?
   - How often do you do those things?

*Fruits: *Label the fruits by identifying all your achievements so far -

   - Any prizes or rewards that you’ve won till now
   - How did those recognitions make you feel?

*Bugs: *Label the bugs by identifying challenges you are facing now -

   - Any issues across relationships, career or self?
   - What were some issues you experienced in the past?
   - How did you manage them?

Now let’s have a look at this beautiful tree of your life. What do you
think? Does it maybe give you a sense of who you are and what you want to
achieve? Whenever you find yourself doubting your future, maybe have a look
at this tree, or maybe even draw one again from scratch.
Looking for further guidance on understanding yourself? Why not get in
touch with an unbiased friend?

*Read the short passage and test your comprehension with the questions that
follow*

*Amazon Snakes!*

The Amazon rainforest is home to a wide variety of notorious, yet
fascinating, snakes. Some of the most deadly (and well-known) snakes in the
world—the green anaconda, the boa constrictor, the lancehead—live in the
Amazon.

Agile on water but awkward on land, the green anaconda is one of the
largest snakes in the world. At 29 feet long and about 250kg, these snakes
are huge! Most people assume that anacondas are very poisonous, but they
are actually non-venomous. Instead, they are constrictors, meaning they
squeeze their prey to death before swallowing it whole. The green anaconda
loves to lie in wait in shallow, slow moving waters like marshes, swamps,
and creeks.

The tree dwelling cousin to the green anaconda is the boa constrictor. Like
the green anaconda, the boa constrictor can also grow to be larger than
most snakes. These snakes prefer to wrap their six-foot-long bodies around
tree limbs, rather than slither through swamps. Because boas are so
muscular, they have no problem hanging on trees until it is time for a
snack. The boa has the capability to squeeze its prey to death and swallow
an entire animal in one bite. Eating such large meals allows this snake to
go weeks before eating again.

By contrast, the lancehead is a much smaller snake. It typically grows to
be about a foot long. Like the boa, the lancehead loves to curl itself
around tree limbs, but it is not strong enough or large enough to be a
constrictor. Despite its size, the lancehead is one of the most deadly
snakes in South America because it is extremely sneaky and venomous. It
stealthily hunts for its prey by using heat sensors in pits on the side of
its face. Once it detects a warm body, it strikes, releasing paralyzing
venom into its victim.

Long and strong green anacondas, constricting boas, and life-threatening
lanceheads are just a few of the deadly variety of snakes that dwell in the
Amazon rainforest.


1) As used in paragraph 1, which of the following choices gives the best
DEFINITION for the word
notorious?
A. included in popular culture
B. famous or commonly celebrated
C. widely and unfavorably known
D. evil or malintentioned

2) According to information in the passage, both green anacondas and boa
constrictors

I. squeeze their prey before eating it whole
II. are larger than most other snakes
III. love curling themselves around trees
A. I only
B. I and II only
C. II and III only
D. I, II, and III


3) Based on its use in paragraph 2, it can be understood that agile belongs
to which of the following word groups?

A. gentle, soft, light
B. athletic, nimble, quick
C. secret, stealthy, hidden
D. gigantic, huge, enormous


4) According to information in the passage, the boa constrictor is

A. extremely venomous
B. the deadliest snake in South America
C. always looking for its next meal
D. six feet long

5) Which of the following statements from the passage best summarizes how
boa constrictors differ from green anacondas?

A. “Like the boa, the Lancehead loves to curl itself around tree limbs, but
it is not strong enough or large enough to be a constrictor.”
B. “Agile on water but awkward on land, the Green Anaconda is one of the
largest snakes in the world."
C. “The boa has the capability to squeeze its prey to death and swallow an
entire animal in one bite.”
D. “These snakes prefer to wrap their six-foot-long bodies around tree
limbs, rather than slither through swamps.”

6) Which of the following choices correctly orders these snakes from
smallest to largest in terms of length?

A. Lancehead, Boa Constrictor, Green Anaconda
B. Green Anaconda, Boa Constrictor, Lancehead
C. Lancehead, Green Anaconda, Boa Constrictor
D. Boa Constrictor, Lancehead, Green Anaconda,

7) According to the passage, how is the lancehead different from both the
boa constrictor and the green anaconda?

I. It injects paralyzing venom into its prey.
II. It curls itself around tree limbs.
III. It searches out its prey, rather than lying in wait.

A. I only
B. I and II only
C. I and III only
D. I, II, and III


*Answer Key*
1-C, 2-B, 3-B, 4-D, 5-D, 6-A, 7-C

*Reading Comprehension*

Read the following passage and attempt the questions that follow to test
your understanding:

Excerpt from the WHO report " Guidelines on mental health promotive and
preventive interventions for adolescents (2020)"

As adolescents transition from childhood to adulthood, they undergo a
number of significant physical,
social and psychological changes. These include rapid neurological
development and associated
vulnerability to a range of positive and negative influences. Issues such
as poverty, conflict,
community violence, forced migration, gender inequality and humanitarian
emergencies can increase
the likelihood of a range of adverse experiences. Factors such as early and
forced marriage, gender based
violence, adolescent pregnancy, poor nutrition, noncommunicable and
infectious diseases and
dropping out of school can predispose individuals to mental health
conditions. The more risk factors
adolescents are exposed to, the greater the potential impact on their
mental health.

Young people face increasingly complex social, cultural and economic
environments with growing
challenges, including increases in forced displacement, migration, unstable
families, income
inequalities, rising levels of mental health problems and violence. Mental
health conditions account
for a considerable proportion of the global disease burden during
adolescence and are the leading
cause of disability in young people. Up to 50% of all mental health
conditions start before the age of
14 years. Suicide is one of the three leading causes of death among
adolescents. Poor adolescent
mental health portends a range of risky behaviours, including self-harm,
tobacco, alcohol and other
substance use, risky sexual behaviours and violence, the effects of which
persist throughout the lifecourse.

Inequities, including those linked to poverty and gender, shape all aspects
of adolescent health
and well-being. Young disadvantaged people from minority and migrant
communities are affected
disproportionately, with poorer mental health outcomes and higher rates of
unemployment and early
school leaving. Females, particularly young girls, face double the risk of
common mental disorders
compared to males. Along with this, depression is also reported to be more
persistent in women
than men. This higher prevalence of common mental health illnesses also
reflects the unmet need
for mental health treatment in women. Sociocultural factors, such as lower
education, poverty,
exposure to domestic violence and abuse and low decision-making power tend
to increase the risk of
depression in girls and women.

1) " adolescents transition from childhood to adulthood", so the correct
temporal sequence is
a) adolescent, child, adult
b) child, adolescent, adult
c) adult, adolescent, child

2) to be "affected disproportionately" means
a) to be affected more than others
b) to be affected severely
c) to be affected more than expected

3) Which of the following statements does the passage support?
a) About half the people under 14 have a mental health condition
b) One is three teenagers may commit suicide
c) Adolescent girls face more risk factors that may cause mental illness

4) Mental health is not always addressed by just counselling the
individual, but also requires addressing social conditions of living. Which
sentence supports this statement?
a) Inequities, including those linked to poverty and gender, shape all
aspects of adolescent health and well-being.
b) Young disadvantaged people from minority and migrant communities are
affected disproportionately, with poorer mental health outcomes.
c) Sociocultural factors, such as lower education, poverty, exposure to
domestic violence and abuse and low decision-making power tend to increase
the risk of depression in girls and women.
d) all of the above

5)  "Females, particularly young girls, face double the risk of common
mental disorders
compared to males. Along with this, depression is also reported to be more
persistent in women
than men." This means
a) depression is not a common mental disorder
b) women tend to suffer depression for a longer time than men
c) both (a) and (b)


Answers
1) b
2) a
3) c
4) d
5) b

Dear students,

You might aware of recent incidence on the missing laptops from Hostel 4 of
Ahalia.

It is important to keep the doors locked while you are not in the room.

In addition, you don't have any rights to enter other rooms and pickup the
things. Not only you are creating unnecessary scenes, tension in the
community but also innocent students get blame.

We will identify the student who created the scene of last week and take
action. The time of Institute and public staff are precious and don't
misuse them for your fun.

In the future, the punishment for such cases will be of harsh one.

Thank you,
Jagadeesh

Dear All,

                           Please see the trailing mail which is
self-explanatory. Hon'ble. PM has urged the citizens to actively take part

Hey everyone!

Hope you’re keeping well.

As the new academic year dawns upon us, so does our responsibility to guide
the latest batch of freshers. First order of business, we have to provide
them with the admission brochure , which will contain all the preliminary
details of getting inducted into our institute. This will also serve as a
first look into our college for any outsider, hence making it a very
important booklet. It’ll be prominently displayed in all our media pages,
as well as the JoSAA website. If you feel like you can contribute to the
building of this brochure by being a part of either the *design team* or
the *content creation team*, do fill the form below *before tomorrow
(6/8/22) night*. You might want to know that there might be some rewards
waiting down this road for you.

*English Idioms*

Clearly, the English think a lot about money, as there are even more
idioms related to it:

1. Midas touch

To be able to make money easily. This idiom comes from the story of King
Midas, who turned everything he touched into gold.

“ Shweta really has the Midas touch. Every business she starts becomes very
successful.”

2. In the red/In the black

To lose more money than you make.

“I’m in the red this month after too many trips to the FoodCourt. I plan to
offer Maths tuition to the private school students for extra money.”

The opposite of being in the red is being in the black, which means that
you’ve made more money than you spent.

“After working a couple of small jobs over the weekend, I earned an extra
Rs1500 and am back in the black.”

3. Receive a kickback

To receive money illegally/to receive bribes.

“The police chief was arrested after the news reported he was receiving
kickbacks from criminals to ignore certain crimes.”

“The traffic cop receives kickbacks for not writing tickets to politicians'
drivers.”

4. Living hand to mouth

To live without a lot of money/ with just enough money for basic needs.

“The family has been living hand to mouth ever since their father lost his
job during the lockdown.”

5. To be loaded

To have a lot of money.

“Baiju paid his Harvard Law School tuition with cash. His family is loaded.”

DAY 276
17/07/2022

*LETTING GO OF ATTACHMENT TO OUTCOMES*

  ♦ Get comfortable, set a timer for at least five minutes, and begin to
meditate. ♦ As you breathe, exhale into deep relaxation.
  ♦ Settle into a sense of relaxed stillness.
♦ Observe the specific thoughts, images, and ideas passing through your
mind.
  ♦ Identify a specific thought or idea as it arises, and tell yourself, “I
have attachments about ___, but I am willing to let them go and see things
differently.”
  ♦ Bring your awareness back to the breath and identify the next thought
that comes up, repeating the statement until the timer goes off.

Dear Candidate,







Greetings from ETS India Resource Center managed by DP Cube Learning.



Here are a few important reasons why you should choose GRE® General Test:

Take the test that is accepted by thousands of graduate schools worldwide, including INDIA: You can take the test now, even if you are still deciding what to do. 90+ institutes accept the GRE Scores in India including IIMs.



Use the test-taker friendly design to do your best: You can preview questions, skip and go back to more challenging questions and even change your answers, all within a section.



Send only your best scores: GRE® tests provide the ScoreSelect® option, which means you can take

with the Degree certificate at the time of convocation. For each additional
copy of transcript(color) Rs. 100 and Rs. 100 for postal charges. The
payment is only for the hard copies.

   The earlier notification was sent because many students write to the

Dear All,

Dr. Gayathri V, who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Florida,
will be giving a talk on *May 13 in room 18 at Ahaiya academic block from
3:15-4:15 pm.*

She is working in the exciting field of Gravitational-wave astronomy and is
part of the LIGO collaboration. She will be giving a talk which will be at
the colloquium level and would thus be relevant for most of us here at IIT
Palakkad. I invite you all to attend her talk. The details of her talk are
given below.

Title: Who ordered LIGO's most massive black hole?
Abstract:
We know of the existence of so-called stellar-mass black holes that form
when stars die, and much heavier, supermassive black holes located in the
centers of galaxies. It has been an open question whether there is anything
between these two populations, in the mass range of 10^2-10^5 solar masses.
These so-called intermediate mass black holes could be a missing link that
connects the supermassive and stellar-mass black hole populations. The LIGO
and Virgo gravitational wave observatories are sensitive to collisions of
black holes with up to about 10^3 solar masses. They have already started
seeing black holes that are more massive than what we expected from stars.
I will outline possible ways intermediate mass black holes can form in the
universe and discuss what we learned about the possible origin of such
events from LIGO-Virgo's observations so far.

Best,
Projjwal

*A brief abstract of the talk: *The rapid increase in computational power,
coupled with the improvements in numerical modeling and availability of
performance data provides a unique opportunity to enhance the resilience
and sustainability of spatially distributed infrastructure systems. This
talk introduces the development of analytics-driven models to support the
design and service-life management of infrastructure systems. Machine

Hi everyone,

In collaboration with Mitra, we're so excited to announce that Akshar
successfully organized a vibrant discussion session on "Why Suicide?" on
Friday, September 16th.

We're so grateful to Dr. Tessy Grace Mathews and Arya ma'am for their
excellent counseling and support that helped us open up about ourselves and
get a great insight into the topic.

We'd also like to extend a big thank you to Cultural Affairs Secretary Sai
Prakesh for his amazing support.
Finally, we want to thank all the attendees for coming.

We're looking forward to your excitement and presence at many more Akshar
events to come!
Check out the brief overview and pictures from the event below.

In the end, we'll like to close by saying Mental health should not be seen
as a negative thing. It is a part of who we are and should be accepted. Let
us all come together to destigmatize mental health.

*What Are Idioms?- A new series*

An idiom is a phrase whose meaning isn’t obvious from looking at the
individual words.

Idioms often rely on analogies and metaphors.

Because they’re used so often in everyday English, if you don’t know them,
it’s almost impossible to understand the context.

Learning common idioms in English will help you fit in with most real life
situations, involving English conversation

The words in idioms often seem totally random or strange when translated
literally.

The key to understanding English idioms is never to look at them or read
them in a literal sense—the words just won’t make sense together. Instead,
you need to learn them in context so you can understand their true meaning.

We’ll start with idioms in English that have some common verbs and then
common prepositions that you already recognize.

Then we’ll move on to common idioms and phrases for money, body parts, food
and nature.


*English Idioms with Common Verbs*
1. *Hit the books*


Literally, hit the books means to physically hit, punch or slap your
reading books. However, this is a commonly used expression among students,
especially American college students who have a lot of studying to do. It
simply means “*to study*,” and is a way of telling your friends that you’re
going to study.

It could be for a final exam, a midterm test or even an English exam.

“Sorry but I can’t watch the game with you tonight, I have to hit the
books. I have a huge exam next week!”

2.* Hit the sack*

Just like the first idiom, the literal meaning of this would be physically
hitting or beating a sack (a large bag usually used for carrying things in
bulk such as flour, rice or even soil). But actually to hit the sack means *to
go to bed*, and you’d use this to tell your friends or family that you’re
really tired, so you’re going to sleep.

Instead of saying hit the sack you can also say hit the hay.

“It’s time for me to hit the sack, I’m so tired.”

3. *Twist someone’s arm*


To twist someone’s arm literally means to take a person’s arm and turn it
around, which could be really painful if you take it exactly word-for-word.

If your arm has been twisted it means that *someone has done a great job of
convincing you to do something you might not have wanted to to do.*

And if you manage to twist someone else’s arm it means that you’re great at
convincing them, and they’ve finally agreed to do something after you’ve
been begging them.

“James, you should really come to the freshers welcome party tonight!”

“You know I can’t, I have to *hit the books* (study).”

“C’mon, you have to come! It’s going to be so much fun and there are going
to be lots of games and good food. Please come?”

“Good food ? Oh all right, *you’ve twisted my arm*, I’ll come!”

4.
*Stab someone in the back*

If we take this idiom literally, it would mean taking a knife or another
sharp object and putting it, with force, into a person’s back.

However, as an idiom, to stab someone in the back means *to hurt someone
who was close to us and trusted us by betraying them secretly and breaking
their trust*. We call the person who does this a back stabber.

“Did you hear that Shaily stabbed Mallica in the back last week?”

“No! I thought they were best friends, what did she do?”

“She told their boss that Mallica wasn’t interested in a promotion at work
and Shaily got it instead.”

“Wow, that’s the ultimate betrayal! No wonder they’re not friends anymore.”

5. *Lose your touch*

Literally, this means to no longer have the ability to touch or feel with
your fingers or hands.

But to lose your touch actually means that you *lose an ability or talent
you once had when dealing with things, people or situations*.

We use this when you’re usually good at a certain skill or talent, but then
things start to go wrong.

“I don’t understand why none of the vegetables I planted have sprouted.”

“It looks like you’ve lost your touch with gardening.”

“Oh no, I used to have green fingers, what happened?”

and Information for applicants | IAEA
<https://www.iaea.org/about/overview/gender-at-the-iaea/iaea-marie-sklodowska-curie-fellowship-programme/Information-for-applicants>.
This year IAEA aims to select 150 students.



The IAEA Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme (MSCFP) was launched
in 2020 by the IAEA Director General in an effort to increase the number of
women in the nuclear field, supporting an inclusive workforce of men and
women who contribute to and drive global scientific and technological
innovation. The Programme aims to inspire and encourage young women to
pursue a career in nuclear related fields, by providing highly motivated
female students with scholarships for Master’s programmes and an
opportunity to pursue an internship facilitated by the IAEA.  Scholarships
are awarded annually, to 100+ female students, subject to availability of
funds. In the selection of students, consideration is given to geographic
and field of study diversity, in addition to eligibility requirements and
other criteria. The selected students are awarded up to €20,000 for tuition
costs and up to €20,000 for living costs for their Master’s programme. Upon
completion of their studies, students are also given an opportunity to
pursue an internship for up to 12 months at the IAEA, its partner
organizations as well as industry.  Additionally, students are provided
with opportunities to attend and participate in various educational,
professional and networking  events.  *Since its launch in 2020, MSCFP has
received 1042 applications, selecting 210 students from 93 Member States
studying in 53 countries worldwide.*  The programme is envisaged to grow
each year to ensure more women have an opportunity to pursue advanced
education in nuclear related fields.



*To encourage broad dissemination of the information, we would greatly
appreciate if this communication can be shared within your network and
among relevant organizations, associations and female students pursuing
Master’s degree in nuclear related fields. *

Dear Students,

    The transition from school to college life is hard at times.  Some
people easily adapt to that and some people feel it's really very
difficult. In between the journey also you can experience a lot of
difficulties.

     Team Mitra would like to explore more about the issues of BTech
students. We expect maximum participation from the students. Completing the
survey will definitely make a change in your life and the students who
will join our institute in the future.

      Kindly spare 5 to 10 minutes and be a part of the change process.

*                                     15/05/2022*

*DRIFTWOOD IN A STREAM*

 Practice at least five minutes of mindfulness meditation today, being
aware of the different thoughts as they arise in the mind.
  ♦ Breathe mindfully, allowing the body to be very relaxed and still.
♦ Observe the thoughts as they pass through your mind, and allow them to
drift past you, like driftwood floating in a stream.
♦ Whenever a thought arises in the mind, silently say, “And there goes
another one . . . ,” bringing the awareness back to the breath.

DAY 282
23/07/2022

*DNA ACTIVATION VISUALIZATION MEDITATION *

We carry all the genetic information necessary for a perfectly healthy and
strong body. In this meditation we will merge mind and matter in an
exercise to activate our highest potential through allowing it to emerge.
  ♦ Set a timer for at least five minutes, begin to meditate, and allow the
body to relax deeply.
  ♦ Visualize your double helix DNA and envision it as it moves throughout
every part of your body.
  ♦ Gradually releasing all the tension in your body, imagine your DNA
radiating bright light.
  ♦ Imagine that this bright light is activating the highest possible
expression of your genetic potential.
  ♦ Visualize your body getting stronger and healthier, your mind getting
clearer and sharper, and your immune system becoming almost invincible.

Dear All,

Ms. Sagila Gangadharan, PhD Scholar in Department of Electrical Engineering
 will be presenting her research proposal on 21st June 2022 at 02:30 PM
through online mode.

*Title: Direction Decoding of Imagined Hand Movements Using EEG based Brain
Computer Interface*

Date & Time: 21st June 2022 at 02:30 PM
Venue: Zoom meeting details are given below
Meeting ID:  952 7960 2677
Passcode:  924456
Meeting link:
https://zoom.us/j/95279602677?pwd=czBkMnNCS3N0ckZOM2Rxc0ZXZmUvUT09

ABSTRACT :

Direction Decoding of Imagined Hand Movements Using EEG based Brain
Computer Interface

Brain Computer Interface (BCI) that decodes brain signals for communication
and control is a rapidly emerging research area. Motor Imagery BCI
(MI-BCI), which detects and decodes the neural activity associated with the
imagination of movement of different body parts is a potential BCI system
that can be used for neuro-rehabilitation and control of prosthetic
devices. MI-BCIs can be employed to substitute, restore and complement
motor capabilities. Conventional MI-BCIs are based on imagination of
movement of distinct body parts like left vs right hand or left vs right
foot, resulting in limited number of control commands. However, an ideal
MI-BCI should be able to provide accurate, naturalistic and continuous
control of the external effector in order to be suitable for real world
applications. This requires control signals with higher degrees of freedom,
which can be achieved by decoding multiple parameters of the imagined
movement, such as speed, direction, velocity and trajectory. The proposed
work attempts to decode the direction parameters of imagined hand movement
using non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG). The research proposal
presentation will cover an overview of MI-BCI systems and proposed
methodologies for direction decoding of imagined hand movement. The
presentation will conclude with a summary of the future work plan.

All are cordially invited.

Do you often find yourself overloaded with work because you are too polite
to refuse when a fellow collegemate asks for your help?

How often have you been in a situation when you wanted something, but were
afraid to ask because you didn’t want to inconvenience others?

Being unable to speak up fearing long-lasting negative consequences can
lead to stress, burnout, helplessness, and damage relationships.

People shy away from being assertive because they associate it with brash
and aggressive behavior. However, assertiveness is not about being brash,
aggressive, or unpleasant. What does it mean to be assertive? Take the
self-test and find out for yourself.

It’s time to #GearUpToGetAhead

*****************************************************

Further to my earlier email regarding the same subject , there is a slight
change in the timings of two buses leaving Ahalia in the morning.

Earlier it was mentioned that the buses will start at 7.15 AM.
But considering that the National Flag Hoisting is going to be done at
Permanent Campus , and all have to be transported to Permanent Campus cite,
It has been decided to start the buses at 7.00 AM , instead of 7.15 AM.
Therefore all students from Ahalia are to be ready to get into the buses by
7.00AM.

The Independence day celebrations are expected to be over by 11.00 AM and
the buses will return to Ahalia with students and the two tempos will leave
to Palakkad with Faculty & Staff through the same route and return to
Ahalia after dropping them at their respective points.

Wish you all a very happy Independence
Day we'll in advance.
